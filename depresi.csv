"does it get betterI have made some progress this year but still wake up and go to bed feeling like i want to die I am not planning anything for a variety of reasons but just feel like I have plateaued on any sort of forward progress i did feel a lot worse months ago and was much closer to ending things so i have improved since then but just feel like I am stuck in this spot my worry is that I will just end up living like this forever I have talked to a handful of people whove just said something like you get used to it you learn to live with it etc or my biggest fear is that it gets worse and really becomes intolerable has anyone ever really gotten better from the point that they were close to ending it to the point where they did not think about it and felt somewhat normal or am i just fucked going forward","SuicideWatch"

"tired of dealing with depressiondepression survivali have a long story that i really need to get off of my chest and i do not know where else to write about it so i was hoping that i could get some feed back I am an average year old suburban male for my entire life i have prided myself on being excellent at everything i do my grades have always been perfect as i am an extreme perfectionist as a kid i had problems with anger management since my parents divorced and my father left us however my mother is a very well educated woman with a stable career that has kept us upper middle class comfortably for my entire life during the winter at age i started dealing with symptoms of crippling anxiety i would have several panic attacks a week i went to therapy once a week and by spring time it was almost all gone the following two years everything went back to normal with a few isolated incidents in between however my senior year of high school things really started to fall apart my uncle who i had looked up to as a father figure my whole life turned out to be a cheating ahole and up and left our family which brought back a lot of feelings from when my father up and left me during that fall i started to start to feel depressed my friends who at the time were very unstable and i started to fight and have petty high school problems which at the time were a big deal to me then around christmas time my grandfather who was basically my dad became very ill as he declined so did my mental health i began to spend entire days in bed and skip school and responsibilities i completely lost my appetite and lost several pounds a week i cried sometimes multiple times a day and even had a suicidal meltdown at the beginning of february at the end of february my grandfather passed away and it was a terribly dark time by then most of my friends had gotten used to me not being around and had pretty much forgotten about me i had no one and had lost several very important people in my life i went on spring break and had a fun time and felt refreshed but a few days in school undid all of it most of my relationships with my peers had fallen to shambles and i still was finding it hard to find motivation as graduation approached i began to feel better and finally after graduation i started to feel like I am slowly going back to my old self but lately things have just been regressing I have been feeling alone and not worthy i constantly beat myself up over the smallest things and tell myself no wonder all your friends do not talk to you anymore i constantly overanalyze everything about people to the way they talk to me and even their text messages because i truly feel that nobody likes me it is driving me mad because it is so exhausting to always beat yourself up the past year has ruined my once healthy self esteem and has ruined my ability to make solid friendships i feel like whenever i start to get close to someone i get too anxious and begin to overanalyze and then it fades away I am very excited to go away to school next year i got into my dream college in the world according to time education and now I am already dreading going away i feel like I am going to fail because i constantly tell myself that I am not good enough and that i will disappoint everyone and myself I am afraid to go away and be away from my mom because i have become so terrible at making friends and so afraid of turning people away that it is nearly crippling i went to orientation and had a fun time but now I am terrified to even text the new people i met there because I am afraid of not getting a response back i really do not know what the purpose of life is anymore if I am going to have to live like this for the rest of my life i feel worthless and alone and i do not even want to participate in society anymore i go to therapy a lot and it really helps but i feel like it wont take away my depression sorry for the long post but i really feel like this is the last place i can go for support","depression"

"i dont understandi dont understand why i spend my time alone i jokingly said i would be forever alone when i was it seems noone is really interested in me either as a real friend of romantically all the people around me seem to want to be around when i can do something for them otherwise it seems there is noone in my life i stopped talking to my friends about how i felt because i was sick of people talking shit about how i was emo or whatever bullshit they wanted to label me I am fucking and I have spent all but a year alone girls keep me around for my relationship advice guys keep me around to help work on their cars but noone really cares about me i drive down the road looking at telephone poles as an easy way to end everything and it merely being an accident so my family wont feel the pain of me intentionally killing myself I have though about that for over years i keep trying to distract myself to avoid that kind of thought but it always returns at first i thought my lonelieness was the result of being a fat ass in highschool and being specifically disincluded and maybe my shyness as a combination of that and being abused as i was growing up so i started introducing myself and making friends to try to overcome it now on any given night i can find a friend to distract me for a bit but i know once i return home there is noone and that none of my friends really understand me they only care when they believe I am at the end of my rope and i feel its more so because I have been a fixture in their lives than them actually caring maybe I am just crazy i dont want to die but i dont want to live its been the predicoment I have been in since i was growing up i can not help but think it would be easier to die but i dont want to hurt my family since i know how it feels to lose someone to suicide so instead i just try to focus on not going back to cutting myself as a release i suspect I will always be a creeper that guy that wont say how he feels for fear of rejection or more accurately fears how that rejection could effect my thinking it seems i spend my whole life trying to avoid falling in another downward spiral I have tried every drug i could get my hands on been so fucked up crackheads are scared to approach me watched the fucking walls melt and tried killing myself with ridiculous amounts of whiskey and cocaine i mean shit my closest longest lasting relationship was with my soon to be step sister i guess I am pretty fucked in the head maybe i should take a long walk off a short pier I am a failure both as a person and as a man why the fuck am i even here seems I have always been the example of what not to be I have talked about some of how i felt and yall recommended i seek help about years ago they just put me on pills and on a month waiting list and wanted me to stop smoking cigarettes never even got to talk to anyone qualified i took a guess as to what my problem was and they just fed me pills now a couple years ago my mom suggested i may have ausburgers or some shit i told her to fuck off but maybe she is right but if they are right there is no cure and no getting better i will only become a drain on the system so if that is correct there is no way i want to live so I have avoided finding out so far i wish i could cry just so i could feel that release but I have been unable to since i was i just can not anymore maybe I am broken it feels like drowning like my lungs are half full of water like I am one drop from choking i dont understand this feeling and i dont understand my life","SuicideWatch"

"got hurt and morefor about four months now ive been happy in my life two of those months i didnt even know what was going on was happiness and i had to learn it but yesterday i was dreadful not a single glimps of happy thought was in my head and i felt as if i was brian dead like i felt during my depression today i decided to talk to one of my favorite people a girl i had know sense the beginning of my highschool year i talked to her she did seem to be talking very strangely i brought up how much i like her as a friend and shes special to me for that she is the only girl ive met in highschool that i kinda like for her personality okay so i told her i like her and she told me now she has a boyfriend this is fine i dont care just it does make her slut i know thats mean but she just broke up with someone and now shes fucking another dude today i realized i dont like her and she isnt the one of course she isnt cause she is a skid shes not happy and has troubles but above all she lets herself be treated like an object and sees me as one to shes not interested in talks she wants dick this is deeply upsetting the journey continues i guess thank god i have been able to tell myself things will get better i was thinking abut how next year in school im going to sit outside on my own cause i was just that sad but i know thats not the right thing to do i have to pick myself up and keep going i think i will keep her as a friend but shes getting nothing from me she smashed a perfect picture i know i sound bad but i just want someone good not perfect not even great but good someone you look at you say ya that looks like a nice girl pardon my french but fuckin hell love is a pain in the balls there is nothing worse then being heart broken its knifes in you chest for months after and metaly obliterates everything should i find love even i dont want sex or a blowjob who fucking cares about that i want love i have come to a few conclusions nothing lasts and everything will crumble to dust i need to become a stone and what i mean by that is be patient save my money not froce love and roll roll roll finally i will never let myself be treated like dirt again it will not happen i must stay on top a good tip for happy people going through hard times is when you feel sad feel really sad feel as sad as you can go outside and lay on the cold ground in the most uncomfortable position until you feel better be careful not to get comfy feeling sad though because i believe this is the cause of depression after you have felt sad tell yourself everything is going to be alright and stay happy and hungry thank you","depression"

"having a lot of negative and sad thoughts lately and i feel like I am stuck in a cycle that is slowly eating my sanityit is really weird i feel happysmiling when my mind is distracted but as soon as I am thinking sad everything turns into a sea of stuff that is been weighing on me lately and it is taking a mental toll on me I have sort of alienated from the people i know because i remember when i was hanging out with people everyday i was just kind of out of my place i wanted to go home and just relax before i had to go to sleep again for the next day so i started doing it more and more until i basically stopped hanging out all together now the times have changed I have got my diploma and started working i suppose the upcoming stress of being unemployed in month is playing some part in the increase of this feeling lately too and when i get home at pm i just want to take a shower relax also known as do nothing for a while watch some streams on twitch and practice my hobby speedrunning videogames but every night i still get the feeling that I am doing it wrong i feel like I am living live wrong because I am not enjoying it with friends or lots of family currently living only with my mother and father is out of the picture I am pretty uptight when it comes to people messing with me i take things way too personal due to what is my self esteem issue this results me into not really being a party personi dont like going out because i always feel like I am some sort of negative spotlight and quite frankly i dislike loud and crowded places that takes away hanging out with a lot of the people i know and used to hang out with since they like to go to the city party and whatnot i am however pretty social and i do see myself as good company when I am with lower amounts of people i did not take the time or at least not enough in my previous late teen years to create a lot of relationships with women only had a few and only one where we got physical after which the news spread around pretty fast that i got unlucky at the meat factory lottery and this crushed me badly in the sense of trying to pursue anyone afterwards in reality all i wanna do is hang out with people at home drink a few beers or whatever floats their boat talk do nothing and play some video games or watch some tvmovies preferably a significant other to love and take care aboutof of course I am willing to make some sacrifices but i really do not want to go out every weekend to create bonds with people that have completely different interests than me but I am currently in the state where i know no one with such desire my skype became mostly people i know online over the past few years and i sometimes spend entire evenings without opening my mouth when i realize that I have been socially stuck for two years now and my job is about to end soon with no replacements or really any jest of what i want next what I am doing now is st line customer support in it and well as you might guess I have had enough of people getting frustrated and angry at me while it is not my fault i just get really sad insidei really feel like when i close my eyes at night sometimes that darkness takes overall the good thoughts i had just vanish and what am i gonna do about this is coming up to mind and it is not even like I am considering suicideperiod but sometimes it just pops by and it scares me shitless just the thought that it is the easiest way to get rid of this mental and social complex I am having it just intensifies this feeling of emptyness and darkness inside and around me i feel like i need to act soon or else this vicious cycle is only going to intensify as life progresses sorry about that massive texti just needed to post i guess and it is probably too much information but i want to throw it all out there in case anyone has dealtis dealing with this with a similar situation tldr enjoying calm and quiet time at home while enjoying my hobby but feeling really sad that I am alone doing this it feels like I am doing life wrong dont enjoy going out loud and crowded places really dont float my boat and I am feeling really insecure when i am at those places hard to find a new friends that share this passion for hanging out but not going out and just chill no girlfriend or companion to spend time with back to i just want to be happy again but i do not remember the last time i was not stressed about the big picture much love guys and girls","depression"

"i have run out of energy and i do not think that i can do this anymorei want to preface this with the fact that i realize my situation may be minuscule in the face of what so many are going through especially at this juncture in history however it also is not fair to weigh problems between individuals this is the lowest I have ever felt in my life i just need to get this out there so someone knows i am a woman in my early s i have a decent job a house car and everything that i need money is tight sometimes but that is how it goes for the past six months i have been pretty unwell mentally i havent consistently taking my meds or going to therapy it has always been off and on i have debilitating adhd and bipolar i disorder i have lived with this for as long as i can remember and was once medicated correctly for it early in my college career however mental health care in my area is completely awful my meds have been changed so many times from the concoction that used to work and ever since then I have never been quite right I have been hospitalized had many many dark suicidal days and am very scared to be alone with my thoughts i despise my psychiatrist and working at the same place that i go for help is really not helpful when i realize how incompetent and selfish these healthcare professionals can be unfortunately this is the only option in my area this past year i met the love of my life we got engaged went to europe together and lived happily together with their child from a previous relationship a few months ago we started getting into pretty bad quicklyescalating fights it would be good for awhile but then things would go south for a day or two rinse and repeat they have mental illness as well so that creates these problems i think i worked on being calm and patient with my partner but things always seemed to cycle back through to fighting after a few weeks of a happy period this past weekend was my birthday and we got into the biggest fight yet over something very minuscule they got their things from our house and left now i am stuck with the bills the trauma of living alone in a house that i can not stand to be in and i have no one to reach out to because my best friend whom i have devoted the past year to is gone they do not want to see me or be with me nor do they think we will ever be able to be together again i am completely broken i cannot find joy in anything anymore as i shared all my interests and hobbies with my person i try to play games listen to music watch tv go outside and do things but i get minutes into whatever thing it is and i just break down i have massive panic attacks and have no one to help calm me down even though i try so hard to be selfsufficient and take care of myself i can not visit my handful of friends due to the pandemic and i can not just go somewhere to get out of the house i sit at work and cry at my desk because i am so unhappy i just want my family back the current political and economic climate really makes things worse by tenfold i can not bear to read the news anymore it makes me angry heartbroken and feel like i live in a world where the future will only bring pain and injustice to those that i love i truly can not keep doing this I have been through a few bad breakups from longterm relationships but this has been the most significant and joybringing dynamic i have ever had i do not want to be with anyone else and the thought of living a life without my person and our child devastates me i built my whole career and future plans around them i have never so strongly considered ending my life before i have never been so serious about it i have researched various methods and decided on how i will do it and when the time is right i thought about going to the hospital but i can not afford to i am still paying the bills from my last hospital visit years ago i just am so tired i have had a very rough life up until the time i graduated college last year and i really thought i had finally gotten everything together i finally felt true real stability and happiness for the first time in my life only to have it ripped away by my shortcomings and lack of attention to my mental state and honestly i just can not do it anymore i just wanted someone to know thank you for listening","SuicideWatch"

"the musings of a year old in a small town be wary of walls of texti suppose i should start with a brief description of myself from the title you have been able to glean that I am years old and i live in a small town I am an analytical person i think things through often too much and find connections I am an intellectual person and i pick things up quickly this sometimes leads to a touch of cockiness on my part but i keep it to myself nothing unhealthy I have been fortunate enough to have a family that has helped me to cultivate my talents I have had many acting and singing e tongue sticking out eriences starting at around the age of but my own personal taste for it did not develop till i was around at an urging from my grandmother i also started a couple types of dance tap jazz and ballroom in nd grade again my own taste for it did not develop till the last couple of years I am part of a nationally competing youth formation ballroom dance team it sounds so official saying it like that really though i get together twice a week with some friends and our coach and we learn to dance and sometimes go to competitions it is interesting how you can say things in different ways for instance i could say I am a young man with a purpose i just havent quite found yet or i could say I am a year old stoner who is failing half his classes it is strange i never thought I would be that kid but here i am i find it kind of ironic though i showed up for one of the final tests in my financial literacy class the one that is designed to show the teacher if you are or are not financially literate i walked in late and left early right after i finished the next day one of my buddies tracked me down and told me i got the top score I am currently failing this class so in case you did not know getting a on the test designed to see if you understand the material in the class does not mean that you pass that class for the last wow i guess it has been at least a few months maybe years it is hard to find a beginning anyhow for the last undetermined amount of time I have been struggling i leave that vague because that is just about all I am sure of it could be said I am struggling with depression i can not really think of anything else that makes it next to impossible to get out of bed every morning makes the things that once meant the world to you seem endlessly repetitive and pointless and has a nice side helping of intermittent suicidal thoughts i have no desire to kill myself but sometimes there is these random thoughts hey i could jump in front of that bus why just take two ibuprofen for your headache when you could swallow the whole bottle stuff like that and sometimes it scares me i thought it was something i could handle alone they have been going on for almost a year now i could dive into my past and make an even more unnecessarily long post however I will give bits and pieces of somewhat relevant information one time i kissed a girl i fell for her hard we dated for months but as almost all high school relationships go it ended I have often thought that this could have been the beginning but i have nothing but positive memories of her and I would never take it back i do not regret it in the slightest it is been years and and a half months i do not miss her any less i wish her nothing but happiness my parents divorced when i was a kid i do not remember it at all and i feel like my childhood was fantastic and short lived i suppose that depends on your definition of childhood though if you were to call me a child now you would not be wrong but being treated as a kid is one of the most frustrating things I have ever encountered even if you happen to be one through the last half of freshman year and all throughout sophomore year i did not really give a fuck about all that much there were my friends there were my hobbies and that was it i did what i wanted and it was really empowering having so much say of what went on in my life i could do a weeks worth of school work then just not go for awhile and call and excuse myself every day i was pretty self motivated and rather good at dealing with schools repressive bullshit eventually i just stopped doing any sort of homework i understood the concepts so what is the point of all this busy work i did not mind getting bad grades if it meant i could have even more free time to do even more of whatever i wanted after awhile i realized however there is a big difference between not giving a fuck and not being able to give a fuck at first i just did not care but now it feels like I am unable to do so anytime i try to start any sort of schoolwork i just stare at it i havent gone to school in a couple days last week i made it through full days and went to work and dance afterwards it felt nice to not be slipping even further behind but then the weekend came and the thought of having to do that again and again and again for what reason it just seemed rather pointless about a month ago i started coming out about my depression and now instead of my books and games being a happy hobby they are outright escapes ways to escape reality and not deal with this i keep telling myself that it is good that i started dealing with it by telling other people but I have been physically sick for a full weeks now let alone whatever this mental plague is and it just feels like it is getting worse i did not used to go cry in my car during my and minute breaks from work writing short stories and poetry used to be a nice way to say what i wanted to say and keep it to myself now it ends with ripped pages and irrational anger i did not used to be this fucked up my friends told me that seeking professional help was probably a good idea so i finally came out to my mom and i know how worried she is but she is helping my first therapy session was supposed to be today but something came up and it got cancelled so i guess i just felt like i needed a different way to say what was on my mind i could go on but i feel like I have said all i need to for now and school starts in an hour and a half and i havent gone to bed i do not think I will be going","depression"

too most people are horrible people and those who are not are suffering just as much as i am and do not need the weight of my problems too so I am here talking into the anonymous void of the internet i suppose I am here because i just want to say everything but not to a person i think the first thing i can do to help myself is actually say what is wrong you know define the problem find a solution attempt repair on friday afternoon i nearly had a panic attack trying to buy a jar of peanut butter from a new store I am a year old man that is truly ridiculous and even more so because I have never been that bad before now i randomly burst into tears when I am on my own and i do not even know I am doing it sometimes i do not realise until i start having difficulty seeing or i feel the tears running down my face even then it takes me a moment to realise what is happening clearly something is wrong and i need to work out what it is so exactly who or what am i i was born into a good family my father was from a long line of very wealthy military men and my mother is a kind and loving woman from utterly bitter poverty they met when at the age of she left home to escape arranged marriage they fell in love despite a decent age difference and i was born at first all was well and my fathers vast wealth and excellent education ment we were fine and happy i played and learned i was raised to value science and empathy i was and still am loved then he died a bullet from an old wound that could not be removed finally moved that tiny bit it needed to and he was gone i did not know or understand any of that i was but there i was one morning trying to wake my father holding his cold hand and asking him to wake up because mother was crying uncontrollably and calling for an ambulance she was obviously upset by something but i did not know what when in doubt go to an adult and ask for help that is what i was taught to do so i did but today it did not work honestly it never would again with that he was gone the money was gone my mother had no money and no access to his he had no living family and no will the only thing we had was the house and a mortgage funnily enough the house was my mothers she had saved enough for a deposit all on her own before she met my father she even arranged the mortgage but now the payments were hers and hers alone once again my private school tuition was now an unbearable e tongue sticking out ense off to state school i went my mother had to get two jobs just to pay the mortgage and keep us fed at the age of i learned to take myself to school and did my best not to be a burden but i was confused and angry i did not understand what was happening and even more confusing was why were all the children at my new school so aggressive and violent I would never encountered behaviour like that before my mother did the best she could to have someone there to look after me what little spare money she had went on a nanny i saw my mother for only a couple of hours a day usually when i came home from school and she was getting the few hours of sleep she could this was how it was until i was in the interim period the various nannies would be there to look after me they stole her clothes her shoes her jewellery her perfumes and her lipsticks every single trinket and memory of her former life gone over the years i had a nanny there i learned that women were cruel selfish and devious they lie and they steal they take and they smile all the while soon there was nothing left and my kind and trusting mother finally realised it was better just to leave me alone that e tongue sticking out ose me to more bad people so there i was but i had bonny my loyal and ever loving dog my only friend she was a rescue puppy when i was a baby she and i would sleep in the same basket as a child i apparently refused to eat unless she was allowed to eat with us so began the habit of eating my dinner under the dining room table with my dog eventually i was persuaded to sit at the table like a normal person but this came at the compromise that bonny would be allowed on the chair next to me she was not small by the way she was a labrador alsatian mix all the size of german shepherd and the smooth colouring of a labrador we even used to bathe together until i was truly the only unconditional love a person can have stayed with me until i was bless her soul and ever wet nose fast forward through a suitably mediocre education i went from an a student top of my class and on track for a decent life to a bored uninterested teenager trapped in a system so badly held together that at one point i had to buy my own wood working tools to complete one of my basic exam courseworks the system robbed me of my enthusiasm for science and education state schools are bad places they are places your childrens hopes and dreams are removed and replaced with the survival instincts and predator prey mentality you either become like the rest or get beaten and bullied into oblivion you enjoy art and science do you have beating that leaves you unable to stand for half a day tell a teacher get another beating and empty platitudes from a teacher who is whole life is nothing more than a desperate struggle to survive the same system you are on your own I am afraid here i learned that men were cruel violent and emotional yep emotional more so than women women always appear to be emotional but it is not emotion it is irrational manipulative and dangerous but not emotion it is something indescribable so i learned the following growing up women will lie and steal from you they will use you make you feel one thing so they can feel another thing they will feed on you men will judge you test you and punish you for not being like them they will test your strength and your will and will try to destroy anything that is weak in their eyes or worse smarter than them that is why men and women fight so much like it or not women are smarter they can kill you without touching you and you will not even know until its too late obvious weakness will get you used abused or e tongue sticking out loited never cry where you can be seen that is a death sentence trust is something that should never be given even those who do not seek to take from you will fail you inadvertently eventually trust only yourself money is more

the radar of as many people as possible the less you are seen the less you have to deal with do no harm and seek no fight but kill if you have too never go down without a fight make the other person pay a heavy price no one is immortal and everyone bleeds quite the list for a year old but it worked i survived a school so violent that we had to have a dedicated police presence of armed officers i was bullied badly but i survived when my time came to defend myself properly i did my father proud i got a detention the other kid got a week in hospital i made some friends as you would e tongue sticking out ect the slightly weird outsider group but they served their purpose and i even retain a friendship with two of them to this day fast forward through all the usual teenage junk no relationships had a bad e tongue sticking out erience of a much older woman who decided that a small boy would be an interesting sexual conquest that pretty much put pay to the concept of love dating and relationships for a long while when i did finally try i ended up gravitating to a damaged woman years older than me with a child in my early s clearly was not going to be a winner and it was not make of that what you will several drastically unrelated jobs later i settled into working as a school media and it technician i know right a school technician returning to the one institution that you know is a meat grinder but to be honest on the other side it is different more importantly things are so wildly different now the children get so much support and help and resources it is a different world and i enjoy being part of that support network if one child goes on to do something good I will be happy not to likely though as of them seem to be entitled brain dead oxygen thieves anyway here i am my mothers health is failing i do my best but i think its alzheimers disease we will find out soon enough i work hard i keep my head down and have a couple of good friends I am not poor not like we were for a while when we could barely afford food and heating for the house was a luxury that came at the cost of eating the house is old though and falling apart so I am fixing it one bit at a time making progress too it is hard but I am getting there my body is not great turns out i have a heat condition was born with it did not even know i had it until it tried to kill me a few years ago but here i am now painfully aware of my own mortality i neglected my body as a teenager and young adult lost in the ability to buy food and have fun suddenly i went wild if you will no drugs well once but absolutely did not enjoy it and ended up having to cook for starving pot heads after recovering from a bout of extreme paranoia now today i am scared of everything every noise the house makes I am convinced it is going to collapse every time i have to go out a socialise it takes two days of mental preparation just to see some I have been friends with for years music no longer

"everything unraveling i do not really have a lot of real people to discuss this with truly honestly I am reposting this from the depression on in case it is more relevant here I will make it shorter though i struggled with depression for a long time and i am now at possibly the worst point in my life ironically because of a cure for depression after basically an entire life time of struggling with depression with constant ups and downs i came to learn about psilocybin mushrooms this was absolutely huge to me there is a mountain of scientific research about the efficacy of mushrooms and psychedelics as treatment for depression anxiety ptsd and addiction some studies make it sound like this will effectively cure people of their depression once and for all with one time use i felt like i needed it because i basically spent my entire adult life trying to figure this out last year i spent a few months traveling which was a great e tongue sticking out erience that put things into perspective for me but there was also this sort of nagging feeling of being lost and confused i came back with more purpose but i still did not know what that purpose was i just decided to get a job and save money so i can move to another country met an amazing woman who basically was in the same place as me i had some sort of a goal so i lived with more hope than i ever had before then i made a giant mistake i ordered psychedelic truffles from a dutch site in hopes it will give me some insight for your information i live in an asian country where drugs are strictly prohibited to extreme measures so i would not even think about getting cocaineheroinmethweed here not interested in such things anyway but i could not find any clear sources online regarding the legality of psilocybin against my better judgement i ordered them they never came and i just gave up on the idea fast forward to this year a cascade of bad things happened everybody suffered from the pandemic in my case i tried to move to another country to start a new life with my partner but things did not work out because countries closed their borders we got stuck in lockdown in another country before we decided to move back to our own countries because we can not enter each others my partner and i have different passports now i was back in my country with no job a lot less money and not knowing when I will get to see my girlfriend again I am leaching off my parents at this point basically back where i was a year ago then things got worse the truffles i ordered last year came to bite me in the ass the authorities flagged the package and came to my parents place to search my room and drug test me my mother freaked out i had nothing on me and tested clear but broke under the pressure and admitted the truffles were mine my country is extremely strict with drugs and the authorities harbor prejudices themselves they do not even know the difference between the different drugs so they think I am some junkie i got a lawyer who costs more than all the money i have so my parents are paying for most of it the lawyer says if the government wants to be strict i can be facing life in prison life for some truffles needless to say this may be the most stressed i have ever been in my life and I have had moments when i was about to end it i feel extreme guilt for my stupidity and for my parents and girlfriend who have to go through this shit emotionally this is the worst thing I have done to my parents and i have not been a good son to them before I have always been nothing but trouble for them and even to myself it looks like i keep looking back at my life and think about the times I have royally screwed up or thought i was going to end it everything comes full circle it is ironic that the very thing i hoped to cure my depression is throwing me into a spiral like no other like the universe is telling me you were meant to be a failure i feel anger and resentment too at the government and society i can not believe they are wasting resources going after someone who just wanted to take psychedelics in his room and not bother anybody i was actually trying to do this to become a better person I am not freaking el chapo meanwhile there are cases of child rapists who get a few years i could have literally raped a child and they might be more lenient on me there is no wonder why my country has one of the highest suicide rates in the world and they might only add to that statistic I am barely holding it together these days all of the hope I have gathered bit by bit over the years is now gone i do not want to go through this to be treated like a criminal i keep looking at my window and wondering if the fall is high enough to kill me instantly the only reason i am staying alive is that i do not want to hurt my partner and parents with my death and i owe my parents the money for the lawyer if things work out and i do not go to prison i have to earn money to pay my parents back but if i get life in prison for some stupid truffles i might as well end it","SuicideWatch"

"i need advice i feel that i am going to lose a friend or myselfhello all forgive me if I am posting in the wrong place but right now i am very distraught and need advice on a friend this may be a very long postmy apologies i used to have a good friend we will call him jody we attended high school together and were both in the jazz band it was not until after i graduated that we became very good friends he is a year younger than me this was about a year ago days passed and he decided to trust me fully for some reason i felt a bit honored since he had so many other friends but decided to trust me all with his thoughts and things and i did the same he showed his true colors as we became better friends but that just did nothing but concern and worry me he always talked about how his life is so miserable he mentioned something that happened in his past that made him this way i was never told what it is he told me how he is sick of all his friends and that he can not trust any of them what bothered me the most was how he said he just wanted to die he told me of an almost suicide attempt with his car but something stopped him from doing it fast forward he asked me one day if i smoked weed i said no and he admitted that he did he said it is the only way for him to forget I am not sure what though he went further and further into a downwards spiral and i think it was because of his drug usage it became heavier and heavier to the point where he would not even sleep but stayed up for hours at a time he did ask me a few times if i wanted to try it with him at first i kept declining according to his other friends he was always trying to get someone to smoke with i remember a time where i needed to talk to him because i was feeling extremely down after my last relationship breakup but all he replied to me was i need drugs to which i replied i need hugs and he never replied throughout our whole friendship he was always so nice and comforting to me he lived over minutes away but he always offered to come down over just so i could cry on his shoulder and as i mentioned before he helped me though my breakup with my last relationship i was a wreck as it was my first every breakup but he was very patient with me and knew what to do to cheer me up and give advice he would always take me to the mall or just on a drive through the neighborhood and even we became a little more than friends for a bit towards the end though he starting ignored me he was not as friendly as before it is as if something changed i knew he was still depressed but i felt the marijuana usage made it worse i invited him over to my birthday party which he did not come since he was not down in my area then a few days later was my actual birthday and he thought i was lying about the whole thing how it was not actually my birthday and all that that really hurt he continued to ignore me even more to the point where he just stopped all contact i was concerned that something happened i wanted to write to his parents telling them of his suicidal thoughts his almost attempt and other bad things that happened involving him i chickened out and never did however i did attempt to call his parents while he was away at college but all i got was the answering machine fast forward to now yesterday i texted him asking if he wanted to hang out to which i found out he completely deleted my phone number from his contacts i instantly started crying that hurt like hell i then got angry and started to rant a bit releasing all the worry anger upset thoughts that i suppressed about him i told him of how i lost two close friends to suicide this year how I am depressed beyond belief and stressed out about him how i lost many other friends this year how i want to be friends i kept crying and crying what worried me more is his responses from what i remember he told me that he is a walking dead man he says he hates who he became but there is a good reason for why he is the way he is i remember him telling me in the past it was because everyones always mean to him and that life just goes on i asked him I am not sure what he is trying to avoid meaning why is he avoiding me our friendship but he just replied life i calmed down a bit and then decided to ask him what did i do wrong that he did not want to be friends anymore he said that he has not talked to anyone from high school since last year i half believe thati know senior year he has a horrible e tongue sticking out erience which may result in that but i still believe i did something wrong to hurt him what it is I am not sure but it has to be something but if it is true that he stopped talking to all his high school friendsis that a sign for something all i did was try to be nice to him and this is what i get in return someone who just wants to cease all contact with me that was the last he texted me i thanked him for everything he is done and i appreciate him so much but as i reread my text it looked a bit sarcastic and i hope he did not intent it that way today i kept thinking how i acted towards him yesterday and felt embarrassed i deleted all the other texts we sent each other and apologized i really do appreciate him always being there for me and i want to return the favor so he has someone who will always listen to him i sent him this text this morning around am and with it I am intending to help him through his depression and whatnot hey listen i know I am probably annoying the fuck out of you im sorry for that but i wanted to apologize for yesterday i was having a horrible day yesterday but there was no need to take it out on you i feel embarrassed so bad that i did that and I am really sorry I have had so many things suppressed that it just escalated my bad mood i just wanted to say I am really worried about you I have been worried since last year to the point where i was going to mail your parents a letter because i did not know if you were ok or not needed help and i know you would probably say to not worry about you but i just can not help it i do that with all my friends no one should feel like that and i just want to try and makes others happy i lost two really close friends to suicide i do not know if i can handle a third no one should feel like that but i just want to start this over if i asked you if you wanted to hang out would you because that would make me so happy even yet would you still want to be friends i had fun with you like when we went to the mall or how you helped me get through my breakup and thank you so much for thatyou definitely made it easier for me to go through and i appreciate it so much i want to return the favor and other stupid things but now I am just rambling either way I am having a party next month and would love t if you came please text me back or call me i have yet to receive a response and its pm i feel like he is not going to respond any time soon i feel horrible I have been crying these whole two days worrying about him and i havent eaten since yesterday he was a great friend and i do not want to lose him i feel like i already lost him figuratively however i feel that i need to be there for him I am someone he can trust he can vent to hang out with all those things i can not imagine losing him for real my question is what should i do to save him I am really worried with what is he is saying and feel that he is going to commit suicide i was thinking about calling him in a few hours to ask to talk but knowing that he probably will not pick up i was also thinking of calling or mailing to his parents later on once he goes back to college in august but i feel that would be too long I am at a loss of what to do i would appreciate all help i know stressing over him is super detrimental to my health and is not helping my own depression either thank you frown edit thank you all for listening to my story i forgot to mention in the previous post since junior year of high school I have always had a bit of a crush on jody i did eventually ask him on a date and to prom senior year which he politely declined he knew i liked him at first which is why we did not become friends until after high school when i was dating another friend of mine eventually after i had the breakup with that friend jody hung out more with me and we eventually became fwbs the last time i saw him was last july i was confused about my feelings for him whether or not if i fell in love with him or if it was just lust he eventually realized this and i think that is a reason why he started to distance himself from me later on i told him through text that i think I have fallen in love with him again which he told me he already knew i regretted saying that immediately because i realized i did not actually love him i just enjoyed his company and spending time with him as friends i think this too could be contributing to his lack of communication i wish i could tell him i made a mistake huh but before i continue my pointless rambles I will stop i think that is enough i just hope whatever I will do will be the right thing for him I am so worried","SuicideWatch"

"my sister tried to kill herselfmy sister is a wonderful person she is bright she is funny she has an amazing sense of humor she is beautiful absolutely beautiful i know this gets said a lot after a person dies or after a person tries but i mean it she should be a model when she was younger she got scouted a few times my sister my mom and i all live in the same house my sister told me she never wanted kids she gave birth to an amazingly wonderful baby eleven months ago the first few months were ok she was extremely jealous of anyone that the baby showed favoritism to my mom seemed to understand this and encouraged that behavior i do not have any kids so I am not sure if it is normal but she would not let me hold the babylook at the baby so i backed off and tried to make myself unseen my sister would take picture after picture with her baby even though she was like this she was immediately depressed after having her baby i would not know if it was postbaby depression or not because she was depressed for a long time before having her baby and then after my mom wanted to try to encourage my sister to go out and do things with her life so she kindof pressured her into going to school i say kindof because my sister did want a job but was not going out and applying or applying online and she was worried about her sitting curled up day after day on the couch and on her bed my sister has a history with drug abuse she went to school and very quickly found some people that did drugs I am not sure if it was just the school people or if it was her old friends that did drugs too that she connected with she told me she went out on xmas and did hardcore drugs with the people just for that night and not after i do not believe her on the not after part one day she came home and was obviously very high i hovered around annoying her helping her watch the baby because i did not want to leave her alone with the baby while she was high i texted my mom this right away and when my mom came home from work she searched her purse and things and found weed and a bong etc this pattern continued for a long time i was around the baby all the time watching her when my sister was at school and when she came home this made my sister super super angry at us she wanted us to leave her alone with her baby but we were unwilling to leave her in such precarious care sometimes my mom would text me begging me to leave them alone because she was tired of my sister texting her but then i would go out and see the baby was left alone in the living room either crawling on the ground or crying her eyes out in the playpen and i was out there again hovering without trying to be seen as hovering it was very stressful i got sick a lot my sister dropped out of school saying she could not handle her classes homework she would often beg my mom to watch the baby so she could do her homework when she got home from when she got home today i learned sleeping time so she was not watching the baby and being a mom my mom did not give her a hard time about it at all and they talked about it at length trying to see if it was a good idea for my sisters depression my sister tells my mom she does not want to be a mom she feels like her baby does not even want her because she does not want to be held by her vs me or my mom i tell her that it is because i spend all day with her now it is true when she spent all day with baby baby wanted her she does not make the connection or this revelation is not making things easier on her a few more months go by and it is the same cycle except now my sister leaves she just goes my mom and my sister have a fight about drugs in the house and she goes to stay at a friends she leaves at am and stays at friends houses i start taking medicine that makes me very groggy during the mornings during this time for my own health reasons i have to stop because she is not always there to watch the baby from am when my mom leaves for work to pm which is when i wake up and can take over watching the baby she often would knock on my door waking me up asking me to watch the baby my mom says that i have to watch the baby so she can look for jobs ok i can do that but i have to stop taking my medicine my mom does not want me to stop taking my medicine but does not know what else to do i stop taking my medicine so i can watch my sisters baby the past few months my sister has always been crying when I have seen her my mom and sister fight a lot about the baby her drug use her depression they talk a lot about things calmly after each fight my mom always tells her she loves her more than once I have heard her saying i just want to be here for you their relationship is difficult i do not talk with my sister other than to tell her about her babys food intake and the occasional comment about babys tv show she is watching she needs to eat more my sister can not tell me the estimated time she ate last she eats more bottles than she is supposed to when she is with my sister i get genuinely angry at her and yelltalk angrily at her tell her that she needs to spend more time with her baby feed her properly take care of her not be on her phone all the time tell her there have been times when her baby is screaming while she is laying on the couch reaching her arms out to her for a hug her baby is not a needy baby if she has enough hugs food warmth diaper changed she is happy to play on her own if she wants you to read to her she will grab a book and actually give it to you for you to read to her if she wants you to do something with her she will let you know when she is on a set time to eat and nap she is honestly an angel i can tell you this with absolute certainty because I have been the one who spends all dayafternoon with her recently she cries after I have done telling her this i do not at the time feel bad because i want her to change i want her to be a mom i want her to be her babys mom i am only stepping in because she is stepping out if she would step up altogether instead of being wishywashy and on drugs then i would not have to do this four weeks ago almost five i tried to kill myself i took a majority of my medicine that is used for antidepressant and sleep and a lot of over the counter pills i woke up midafternoon and spent a lot of time puking my sister did not ask and i did not tell i genuinely thought and think if i was not here my sister would have to step up and be a parent maybe she would be better with more pressure and being the only one right now it seems to me that she is only doing this because she knows that she can walk away and have someone else look after the baby i get this line from my mom who said my sister told her that when she left one night i thought if i was not around itd be a lot easier on everyone a few days ago she tried to kill herself she is coming home in a few days other than being as supportive of her mental health as possible without being overbearing how do i do this we do not even talk it was strained and awkward before i can not imagine it will be any better now I will be deleting this soon i just thought maybe this form would have

"and we are back same shit different dayi always heard that depression is way worse when you are an adult but i never really believed it though I am not legally an adult until may and I am also not really an adult at all I am starting to understand what this means i graduated high school in november last year and went to the other side of the country with my best friend for our schoolies week see most kids my age go to the beach for a week long drugs and booze fueled party where everyone ends up malnourished and wishing they never went in the first place i had a break down in perth during my schoolies when i had the realisation that i do not go to high school anymore i mean high school sucked a lot i was bullied from one end of my school to the other but and this sounds really dorky the teachers and support that was around me made the whole e tongue sticking out erience bearable and halfway through our visit in perth the reality that they would no longer be around me dawned and i finally found out what it was like to look after myself we returned to brisbane after our week both skinnier than when we left and both trying to negotiate the airport at smiley in the morning it was not long until the golden summer of parties began we had three months off before university started and that meant more parties and more alcohol after being successful in receiving a new years kiss from a boy that i had long since had my eyes on i started dating a different boy we will call him john he was kind and gentle he made me feel as thought i was important which was new for me we went to see star wars since i loved the movie so much and afterward my parents let him stay the night which they had never done before but for some reason they let him we stole a bottle of vodka from upstairs and he watched and waited until i was very drunk i could not see straight and my teeth were numbing i saw him smile at me over a half full glass of vodkaorange with a smile on his face I am going to make a mistake with you he said to me as he crawled across the couch i backed up a little but in my state it was more of a lurch but i do not care he leaned forward and kissed me lots i did not know what to do i was just going with it that was only my second kiss it had been three years since i had kissed anyone he kept going i was shrinking away from him and i was tense as a plank of wood he tried to take off my shirt telling me i was beautiful he continued taking off my clothes while i tried to get away from him there was a point where he had pinned my arms to the floor while he grabbed at me anyway this continued until i started to cry after that i think he snapped out of it i felt so dirty and used i had bruises on my hips and a pain in my side he sat staring at me with a half remorseful and half proud look on his face you made that so difficult you are such a tease he said before getting up and sleeping in the rumpus room outside of my room the next morning he chatted like an old friend with my mum while i stayed quiet in the passenger seat we dropped him off and he left i burst into tears and e tongue sticking out lained to mum what happened I am not defending him in anyway but you were both in a fairly silly state and it was your first time it is always awkward she said before promising she would not tell my dad anything i thought for a moment it would not have been so bad if i just went along with it right maybe i am just a tease no less that a week later my friend with whom i went to perth with was having a party at his dads house i went along with twin who have been friends with me since we first moved to brisbane when i was on the way one of our friends used his fake id to buy a bottle of vodka which one of the twins and i solidly demolished before we even got to the party by the time we were there i felt thoroughly drunk and self destructive i slutted around the party because of how dirty i already felt i did not think it could be any worse i got with two boys that night something I would never done after that the details are blurry but i woke up in a bed sandwiched between a boy and a teddy bear but thankfully we both had our clothes on i crept out of bed and snuck out of the house after saying a quick goodbye to the host i walked all the way home listening to loud music to blur out everything i was thinking but then john came back he begged me to come to his birthday party and since my best friend was going i decided i would too and that turned out exactly the same as last time and that brings us to the moment where the mid semester break is fast approaching and john has made it very clear that I am not good enough for him now that i have had some truly adult e tongue sticking out eriences I am wondering whether or not this is how adults deal with depression by drinking to excess and seeking meaningless affection to numb the pain i do not know why i wrote this i guess I have always thought that writing things out that have happened help me to work through things and get past them but if any actual adults have any advice for better ways to do and to mend a thoroughly broken heart that would be most

"miserable thinking about quitting college and reapplying next year in a different country but worried extremelyI have been thinking about quitting college and it is making me feel really conflicted and depressed you see ever since i was a kid I have wanted to move to a different country and i always thought that once i finished school i would do exactly that I would travel abroad finally escape my complicated relationship with my parents just start over you know but then the time came and i got scared because what if i do not fit in what if i end up not connecting to people because that is what usually happens to me but this time do not even have my parents to talk to what if i run into a language barrier sure my english skills are great but still and then what if I am just not ready to live on my own so i stayed i got into a free place in college the country is paying so i can get my undergraduate degree for free so i figured stay for years get my degree for free and then move abroad to continue my studies except that I am miserable at least when i had a friend it was tolerable but ever since she dropped out I have been feeling like a complete loser and failure always alone i tried making new friends but everyone already seems to have their own little groups and suddenly there is all this work i need to do exams i havent began studying for tests i accidentally missed and now have to catch up on all on the week before christmas which is usually such a great time for me and i know that if i stay I will spend those years miserable only interacting with the world when college demands just like when i was at school but maybe if i leave things could be different i do not know maybe i could be happy if i do not quit now it will not even be an option later because then I will have to pay back some of the money my country wasted on me so if i quit now i could enjoy christmas without worrying about all the problems and anxiousness college created for me and then move to uk get a job and start college there next year except that my parents would be furious i quit and heartbroken that I am moving to a new country and maybe I would just end up making the situation for myself worse all of this is going through my head and all this anxiousness is making me feel really depressed what should i do","depression"
"living in fear and dreadim years old when i was i was traumatized by a mental hospital stay they made me take laxatives and a bunch of different antidepressants the hospital was infested with dead bugs everywhere they locked us away like animals and even if you came voluntarily you were not allowed to leave voluntarily the average stay at that hospital was days according to the other patients i was lucky and i got out in days i did not fight back i listened to everything they said and i took whatever they gave me but still they said that i needed to be locked away they claimed that i tried to commit suicide and put it on my record the hospital was poorly kept the staff would sedate you whenever convenient and one nurse stabbed me several times with a needle for a blood test in the middle of the night while i was having a severe panic attack i lost all my rights when i was in that hospital and i still do not feel like i have any rights to say the least it was scary now its been years and everyday since i got out I have gotten night terrors about this hospital and what they did to me and the other patients one of my past therapists diagnosed me with ptsd which was surprising to me because i thought that i was just being unreasonable I am extremely paranoid about going back to a mental hospital or even seeing anything that reminds me of a hospital a doctor or a needle I am usually either in extreme fear or i have no emotion so it is one extreme or the other i wish i was dead i wish someone would just kill me already I am too scared to kill myself because i know that if i failed i would be put in a mental hospital again but still I am tempted to at times i used to cut after half a year out of the mental hospital but i eventually stopped after i started going to see a therapist then my therapist got a new job and left then i got another new therapist and then they quit and for the past months i havent met a new therapist or gone to therapy I am really out of it especially because one of my doctors said that i needed to take a blood test soon around my birthday in june this year and I have been having nightmares about that since then everything has gotten worse i know people just keep telling me its just a needle and i know it does not hurt but the fear i felt when i got my last blood test was at the hospital and i was paralyzed in fear my face turned completely white i lost my hearing for a good minutes and i felt like i was choking to death i thought i was going to die and i havent been able to convince myself that i will not die so i dont know what to do now my family is doing everything they can to help me cope with this and the nightmares and trying to find out a way to help me with the blood test situation but nothing has helped so far the people at my clinic do not care if i get a severe panic attack and lose my hearing temporarily again they do not even want to try to help every night i get a panic attack because of this and it is not fair i wish i was dead anything would be helpful anything someone help","SuicideWatch"

"I am a whiny little shit and a bad personand i deserve everything that is currently happening to me some pretext I am currently a late twenties unemployed shutin my life up until about a year ago was pretty good i had a good youth with loving and caring people around me my family had everything going for it financially as well so i never was short on anything i went to good schools and passed them with relative ease I have always been told i was fairly intelligent but i never had the motivation to really try and test that intelligence so i just cruised along in highschool then started college i had no idea what i wanted to study so i picked a broad study business administration in which i would hopefully find my interest as i progressed in it i also joined a fraternity hoping to make some friends in a new city it never really was my cup of tea to start with but i did it nonetheless i failed my first year because the interest never came but it helped me realise i did not want to be groomed into some greedy business man that the study kind of wanted you to be i switched studies to public administration at least with that the emphasis is on helping society through governance i slowly but surely went through this study again not extremely motivated by the subject but i felt i was at least working towards something good in the form of a degree i stopped my involvement with my fraternity pretty early because i did not really feel connected to the people in it i broke of contact with most of the people i knew from it except for a few actual friends i graduated and went on to follow a masters because that is the thing to do at least it is in my social environment i was extremely happy during my start of my masters everything was going great i was in the top of my class and onroute to graduating cumlaude until i had to cross one final hurdle writing a thesis as is evident of my lifes description i have trouble getting and staying motivated for anything and this is coupled with extreme procrastination i delayed the start of writing my thesis for about months before finally deciding on a subject and reaching out to a professor to become my thesisguidance even during the writing progress i was dragging my feet constantly what should have been a project of maybe or months turned into months turned into a year turned into nearly years now i currently have no contact with my professor because i know i fucked up and i do not want to face the music i quit my masters about weeks ago my old grades were going to e tongue sticking out ire and I would basically have to repeat the entire study while still writing my thesis i could not face going back there here is the crux of the matter i tell everyone around me friends and family that I am still working on my thesis that i just have some troubles here and there my professor and second readers are being a bitch and constantly finding faults with what i supply them but rest assured my graduation is coming soon i just need a tiny breakthrough this is what i tell people constantly I am living a big fat lie and i seem to be the only one that knows it i tell myself they can not be this believing can they they must know I am bullshitting them right but no one seems to question it too much the real thing that is eating me up is that my family backed me financially through pretty much my entire collegelife i had the odd parttime job here and there but never with the intention of needing to do it to keep myself from starving and more of a well it is the normal thing to do here i am living a big fat lie and still mooching of of my parents in the most disgusting way imaginable i should be looking for a job but with my shitty motivation and procrastination nothing ever comes of that idea so here i am a guy that had it going for him pretty much all his life until the moment i become a gigantic pussy and started running away from my problems instead of acknowledging them and now that I am acknowledging them i feel like it is too late to do anything significant about them i wasted + years doing a study that now has zero rewards and only cost the people around me i never took the opportunity to build a network or get started on a normal job thus i have zero real working e tongue sticking out erience if people would look at my cv they would notice a massive hole of time where my masters should be so i doubt many employers would be to thrilled to invite me for an interview the bubble of my lie is going to burst and soon it will probably be a good e tongue sticking out erience for me to finally get slapped out of my mooping around but i dread the moment i know exactly what i should be doing come clean of my big fat lie i know my family and friends will be pissed about lying to them put would probably see past it in time i just hate to dissapoint them so get a simple job that allows me to live my modest life and that will maybe bring a spark to my dull life i still have a decent bachelors degree right I am still fairly intelligent right i just need to catch that one break where an employer is not looking for year relevant e tongue sticking out erience and takes a chance on me right look into some counseling maybe talking about my menial problems with someone who is not related or otherwise invested in me might be good this post is sort of my first step to that i guess then why is it i do none of these things and continue to spiral down a depression as the title suggests","depression"

"my failing battle against depressionhiya this post is more of a venting session for me so i apologize in advance if this is not the norm for this thread but i just wanted to tell my story to an audience that has a bit more e tongue sticking out erience with depression than my family and friends do so to fill you in on my situation a bit I have been dealing with major depression for the better part of a decade now + yrs and it just does not seem to be getting better that fact alone depresses me because I am only and these are supposed to be the best years of our lives i was bullied and became an outcast in high school and did not talk to anyone about it until after i graduated then once i started college i tried to make things better by taking medications and by seeing therapists but it was not the ticket either therapy is nice to simply have a dedicated outlet for support but in general they are more just a sounding board to get you talking about your feelings this treatment went off and on again throughout college and the longer it went without answers the more and more hopeless i became fast forward to this past september i finally started transitioning from male to female because that was one of the things ate away at me like crazy throughout my childhood and was finally at the fuck it point where i took the leap of faith and started the process throughout all of the roller coasters involved with that process it is been overall a positive e tongue sticking out erience but for every up there also seems to be an anchor that pulls me back to my sad reality i know it was unrealistic that it would be a fix all for all my problems but you have no idea how much i prayed that it would the thing that troubles me the most right now is that state of mind I am in i have nothing to live for i went through k college landed a job and started the adult life but it seems so meaningless i think it would be different if i had a relationship or had any interest in being a relationship but i do not the chance of me finding someone who is tolerant of my transition and is also asexual is just soso low even if i did find someone it is like I have lost the will the live and i do not have it in me to give the whole thing one last go I have lost my faith over the years so i do not even have that belief i just feel like the cards that i was dealt with are so bad it is funny do not get me wrong I am grateful for the opportunities that I have had and it is been an uphill battle for most of my childhood but i just do not know where to go from here the whole it will pass saying has sort of lost its meaning to me because I am not sure how much longer I am supposed to wait sorry for the rant but if you made it this far thanks for reading blackrose","depression"

"i need help and advice on an unusual situation that triggers depressionhey guys I am a year old american boy i have bipolar disorder i used to take lexapro mg for depression but i quit taking them about months ago I am completely unmediated I have been pretty okay since then but right now and lately I have been extremely low and i wanted some more opinions about what i should do heres my situation there is a tl wink r at the bottom backgroun tongue sticking out i live in a rural part of a midwest state and I am attending my last year of highschool here having just moved from the east coast my mom remarried a farmer who lives in the middle of nowhere growing up I have lived in different states on both coasts and in different kinds of neighborhoods i consider myself e tongue sticking out erienced for a year old especially compared to the local residents I have probably seen more of this country than of this countys population has frankly this area is extremely depressing its farming country the town closest to me has a single way intersection if i had to describe it with a color it would be grey I have found people i attend school with have a seemingly higher chance of being genuinely racist andor homophobic which essentially tells me that they are ignorant and uneducated people in the area lack ambition most of them are born here and never leave the county naturally i do not have a plethora of friends just a few acquaintances I will hang out with on occasion perhaps to play some music or something like that in reality i do not really have anyone i could talk to about something this serious that is why I am here using a throwaway anyway this is not what is currently put me in such a bad place i just want to guys to see how unhealthy of an area this is and why it contributes to my depression now heres what the current problem is as i said I am only in months which means i still live with my parents with this kind of situation comes the inevitable occasional grounding I am grounded currently because i let my grades slip upon being accepted to college now this is not a post by a teenager bitching about how much being grounded sucks it is a legitimate question of is this an appropriate situation for someone like myself to be put in as of now I have been grounded for weeks I am due for another weeks on weekdays I am away for school from smiley this provides a small amount of social contact as i do not enjoy the company of most of my fellow students on the weekends i do not leave the house obviously that is what grounded means it was this past weekend in particular that i realized that this might be a serious situation friday i get home ish my moms home thrilling downstairs into my x foot basement room no windows i sleep smiley smiley i wake up lay in bed mess around on my computer until smiley until i fall back to sleep saturday wake up smiley ish i know today is going to be hard i just hope i can find enough to keep busy to keep the bad thoughts away i eat breakfast i shower i shave i do laundry other menial tasks to try to kill time eat lunch I have done about all i can and its in the afternoon i lay back in bed hours later and I am in bad shape havent gotten out of bed yet havent spoken a word to anyone all day no emails no texts i scroll through my phone looking for someone i could talk to about how bad i feel i decide I am not close enough with anyone to burden them with my problems i put my phone away lay in bed for the rest of the day just thinking i let my thoughts start sunday today wake up go upstairs I am the only one in the house eat breakfast take care of the rest of the laundry that i neglected to finish yesterday clean my room a bit it is smiley and i can feel things start to fall apart there is nothing to do i do not like tv I have read all my books I am not motivated or inspired enough to write anything music i lay back in bed lay there until check my phone my dad called at some point leaving a text if you do not answer your phone I will suspend your cell service not a threat ironically its really not a threat i can not remember the last time somebody called or texted me without me calling or texting them first i start to think while i lay there i wonder if mom knows this is what i go through when I am grounded she could not possibly know that i get this depressed right but i havent spoken to her in days can not she tell somethings wrong with me i wonder if she has a sense of empathy thinking more i wondered if these circumstances have passed the threshold of commonplace punishment and crossed into areas bordering induced suffering so heres where i am I have begun to think that personally being subjected to complete social isolation is an unfit punishment for a teenager with a history of depression and bipolar disorder on the weekends days crawl by while i waste away in my bed being teased and tormented by thoughts of what i could be doing i havent had any suicidal thoughts or actions in more than years but i currently feel extremely depressed and uninterested in life so I am thinking maybe i should talk to my mom about this i do not think she understands in the slightest the psychological impact that circumstances like these have on me i think for most teens being grounded is a typical punishment of course it is not fun but they wait it out they bide their time and before they know it they are back out there living their lives for me it feels like I am a prisoner even though i know it is temporary it seems to never end and i have weeks left hours drag along i try to find ways to avoid thinking because if i start thinking i realize how miserable i am and how without purpose my life is i do not communicate with people for days on end there is nothing to look forward to there is nothing to get out of bed for my good qualities fleet away from me until i feel like an empty person devoid of any emotion she can not possibly know what this feels like so what do you think i should do talk to her i do not know if she would understand my mother is not very understanding speaking objectively please do not hold back any advice is helpful tl wink r I am unmedicated with a history of depressionbipolar disorder do not have many friends live in a relatively depressing environment I have been grounded for weeks got to go during grounding i go days without communicating with anyone some days i do not even see another human i get inside my own head and get extremely depressed i barely leave my bed i do not think my mom who grounded me realizes how unhealthy of a punishment it is for me personally I am wondering if i should talk to her i do not care if she punishes me really it is just that this is like a personal hell and it is beginning to take a toll on me assuming people read this thanks","depression"

over a week ago where i rolled the car it was a jeep lifted no roll bar it had a roof though i did not have any major damage i hurt my shoulder which feels almost better now that was the most of my damage i hurt my ribs and got whiplash it hurt to laugh for a few days five or so but it was easy to not laugh as i usually fake my laugh to make my friends feel better i was lucky to just get up and walk away like it did not happen so they say earlier that day i thought things were okay you see I have been depressed for a long time and a few months before this accident my suicidal thoughts stopped when i made some friends i met they meant a lot to me and even for awhile i thought things would be okay i do not even know if i can say i was depressed then i was happy i finally knew what it was like to be happy it was great the whole time though i was still a little out of it as my grandpa was in the hospital he came home three weeks ago and after a few days he had a heart attack we were worried about him and that is where i started to feel sad again i did not think much of it as it was different to when i was depressed a different sadness just a normal losing something sadness other than the numb depression feeling he had surgery and was alright the day he came home though my dad went to the er emergency room from armchest pain he had a heart attack i had to take care of grandpa while mom was at the hospital with dad while feeling empty inside it was different it felt like there was a part of me that was gone and i was anxious walking around aimlessly waiting for that part of me to come back to me something that was always there suddenly gone i was missing it dad was alright a few days in icu intensive care unit and two surgeries later he was let out so i had to take care of him also along with taking care of my mom because she is been getting old and i had to take care of her before this all of those things piled up onto each other and i felt empty i mindlessly took care of them and I have matured because of it and when they can take care of themselves more i was going to get a job my dad is very strong and is already taking care of himself again and taking care of mom as I have been absence for the week by absence i mean mentally stuck in my own mind the day before my dads heart attack i spoke to my friends as sometimes i avoid everyone to keep helping my family i felt alright with them after i left i felt lonelier than i ever did before i was on my bed feeling so dead and thought itd be best if i give up as it was pressure taking care of my mom and knowing I would have to take care of grandpa the next day i was going to end my life but i got a text from another friend and i got online and started chatting with her i did not want to abandon her the next day when i knew of my dads heart attack i felt so selfish i had to take care of people my dad had a heart attack and i was trying to turn my back on them so i kept going we kept telling dad everything was alright and my other grandpa was going to pay the rent rent is over thousand we had dollars to our name and the rent was due in five days and everything was alright after awhile dad got stronger i felt a little better the day of the accident i felt alright i went to get a book and a shirt and then took mom out for sushi as it was her favorite food with grandpa paying the rent for two months we had some extra money i felt alright i felt great happy again i walked around with my back straight instead of caved in looking down i looked up and walked with confidence thinking everything was alright for once i thought things were okay and i was happy i thought everything would stay okay that things would keep getting better for once i wanted to live instead of die we were at the

side and since it is a jeep at some point my mind thought we are going to flip onto my side please no we went straight for a car in oncoming lane so we swerved back to the other side and missed the car i think that was the car who stopped and they came to help us and we drove off the road and the car slid sideways onto my moms side i then just remember feeling lifted up and i saw the world outside the windshield slowly everything felt slow turn to it is side before it fell to the side i raised my arms up to hold onto the roof of the car and closed my eyes and then everything felt so fast i remember the feeling when the side of the car finally hit the ground and i remember being upside down for so long then i felt everything stop there was a lot of weight on my arms so i thought i was upside down still but when i was able to open my eyes and see two people walking to the car i realized we landed on the wheels the wheels i can not e tongue sticking out lain how much relief i felt it is rare to actually land on the wheels after your car rollsso i thought and what everyone said anyway i felt my moms arms around me and i heard her voice asking me something i did not know what it was but i think it was if i was there or okay and i said I am okay I am okay i can not see i realized i lost my glasses i found them in the back seat found my phone feet away from my car fell out in the first roll i assumed mom and i were okay but we were sore the next day I have been on pills since then for pain and such but i think i will not take them tomorrow as i feel that good now as far as my body it is fine but my mind will not stop i had nightmares every night since and it keeps playing in my mind the sliding the car tipping over feeling of being upside down since then I have felt empty numb i can not even get into the car without a panic attack our car is low and I am sure you would have to be actively trying very very hard to roll it but still every turn and when we picked up my brother the next time that road it was all too much actual fear i felt so cheated where i wanted to live for once just to have any hope taken away I am alive i should be thankful happy even but i feel like the spirit i was getting was taken from me the courage i finally found to even go outside in the first place is gone I have been afraid of going outside in case i get hurt or something i feel so empty and numb i feel so dead on the inside I have been trying to cope with it I have been fighting through these urges to just give up I have been trying to cope with the accident so i can hopefully get over it sooner I am either thinking of what happened or thinking of how to end the suffering I have been having for the past months or wanting to reach out and get help i want to cope with this I am terrified that every time my fiends say goodnight it will have to mean a goodbye because they will have to wake the next day and get the news that I have killed myself as much as i want this to end I am trying really hard to find something to help me cope with this does anyone have any advice I am really trying I am sorry if I am a lost cause here with being suicidal and depressed for years now but i finally believe i can be fixed and i need to get past this now to get better i need to cope with the car accident i assume I will heal more naturally with time but i do not know how much time i have with a suicidal mind","SuicideWatch"

"people that think about committing suicide are irrationalno no and no i do not think my thinking is erratic actually I am pretty sure I am being not only rational but fair planning a suicide takes time and effort you have to consider all the factors rationally to not fail you have to think about the best or more efficientcleanless painful ways to do it and how to execute it i need to make sure about all the things that can go wrong in the process consequences of surviving an attempt like brain damage or other disabilities choose carefully a place to do it if you prefer to do it outside a perfect moment with no interrumptions too make a letter with all your wishes regarding your body delete all your information in your pc or phone to not left trace behind of what you have written before there is too much going on with the planning many aspects that cannot go unnoticed it requires critical thinking after all to me that is the most rational decision ever not only you are considering yourself in the mix but others also it is fair because what is the point of making someone live in pain we have the option to die to end our lives my life is only mine and nobody can take that away from me saying we are irrational to me is dumb they do not know how it feels or how it is","SuicideWatch"

"I am terrified that i might kill myself soon any dialogue is extremely welcome I am not entirely sure of where i should start or even if this post belongs here but I am not sure where the hell else it would belong I am seventeen eighteen by this november I have been through a rough childhood i do not want to specify what went down but i have diagnosed ocd ptsd depression and a currently noted but not yet properly diagnosed empathy issue which came about around the same time as the ptsd i will say that part of the rough childhood involved my being groped nonconsensually multiple times and forced into kissing + threatened with rape by a boy my age who had forced me into dating him other stuff was going on at the time as well but again I am not a big fan of specifics i will say my parents went through an extremely rough divorce at the time right after we moved away from my childhood home to a place i never really liked and this resulted in pretty consistent unintentional abandonment and a huge disconnect between myself and my parents as i began to crumble that was not their faults it was just how things went and we all came out of it hurt i was supposed to graduate this year i say supposed to because i obviously have not since th grade where my parents really started fighting I have had horrible depression and school was an impossibility I would go but i was never really there not mentally i was constantly getting yelled at and told i was lazy or not trying hard enough by teachers and as a kid who had gotten straight as all my life before the depression i had no idea how to handle this i kept trying to tell people it was not me it was something in my head and i was terrified and that i did not feel safe anywhere and could not do my work because it made me feel unintelligent unsafe and angry and a whole smoothie of emotions i still can not place nobody believed me nothing ever got better since then I have been the lazy kid with no motivation the kid who used to make my parents proud now i listen to them praise my friends as i do makeup homework just to graduate my teachers all speak about me fondly because I have always been good with socialising I am socially confident at least and always love to talk to teachers and adults but when it comes to grades or anything with actual meaning it is always you are a smart kid and that is why I am so disappointed in you i get high scores on tests because i truly do love to learn though nobody believes me and on every english exam I have scored extremely high writing and drawing are two things i adore with a slight emphasis on the former and i put my heart into learning anything to do with either but my being good at the testtaking has only convinced everyone that my lack of ability to turn homework in truly is simply a product of laziness i wonder whether they are correct or not maybe they are i do not blame any of them i barely tell them about what I am going through until i burst and all they must think is that I am making excuse after excuse i lie all the time to make people hate me less especially about whether I have done homework or done this or that because i do not want to let them down so I am sure everyone assumes I am lying about the depression too to get out of doing things i disappoint everyone my parents constantly bring it up even if they do not say it outright all the time my teachers did everyone i thought loved or cared about me always ends up telling me the same thing I am a disappointment to them and it is because I am lazy and ungrateful sometimes i believe them and start to forget how difficult it is for me to do anything these days i havent gotten my driver license yet most of my other friends havent either but i completed my required thirty hours of study since i was being ungrateful for e tongue sticking out ecting rides places i got the certificate i was supposed to take in to the dmv and then i hid it and now i can not find it i suppose i hid it awfully well i was so stressed about the idea of taking the test because i knew I would fail and let everyone down like i always manage to do and then my parents would talk about how my best friend is so much smarter and better than me and can actually do things successfully and then I would get scolded for being lazy and not studying hard enough probably justifiably all of my friends are going off to college either their parents paid or they got amazing grades i wish i could be happy for them but instead i feel a burning anger an agony that is eating me from within they talk about how anxious they are to move away in a week to go off to beautiful mountainous universities and learn everything they could possibly dream of and i can not help but want to scream in their faces about my anxieties about the anxieties that will grow in the soon to be empty spaces my friends once populated i want to rake my nails down my face as i tell them how jealous i am that the worries in their minds are ones of how their amazing new lives will be while i remain here alone dissolving into nothingness i do not say anything to them i do not want them to know how much it hurts me that would just be an extra burden on them when i give them my goodbyes they smile and say we will meet again soon when they give me theirs i can not help but feel the crushing finality of it all they are moving forward and I am unable to follow sometimes when I am not having night terrors i dream about meeting them and their parents again but in these dreams they all hate me and I am a pathetic bug to them sometimes i feel that way in real life i always suspect my friends are lying to me about everything and that in the end i am a only a burden to them they must despise me for how useless and selfish i am i havent been suicidal or at least i do not think i have been I am not sure at this point i love my writing even though it is stilted i love my art regardless of its quality and i love so many of the people in my life even though i doubt they love me back and i know they lie to me to keep me from getting hurt by the truth i do not want to kill myself i want to continue my writing and my art and everything i love doing i do not want all of that to be lost to the vast nothingness of death the thought terrifies me death itself is a horror to me there are so many things i love and do not want to leave not yet not any time soon the thought of not being able to chase my dreams and pursue my writing and art further hurts me which is why I am terrified recently in these last two months suicidal thoughts have crept back into my mind from wherever they were sleeping after my first bout of true depression when i was young I have found myself slipping into violent thinking full of anger and fear and suicide has been a common thought i wonder over every few hours it has not formed into a want yet if anything it is quite the opposite I am terrified that i will kill myself that I will snap and take my selfharming too far i have read so many stories of people just like me who feel desperately out of control but who think they will never kill themselves only to one day lose their grip on reality lose their strength and take their own lives just like that i dread that idea i hate knowing that even though right now i do not think i will kill myself within the next few days the more i question it the less sure i feel of that do i know for sure i will not kill myself no i do not if anything i have no trust for myself i have fallen into manic states of depression and who is to say i will not do so in the next week and make a sudden decision it is not beyond me I have done it before when i was twelve just after school only to be stopped by my sobbing mother pounding and begging on the other side of the bathroom door though i doubt she had assumed i was aiming to bleed myself out that day i cannot confidently promise myself i will not take my life sometimes the thought even sounds good other times I am so incredibly apathetic to everything so incredibly dead mentally that i could not care less these times terrify me lately I have noticed that i will be sitting in a car or crossing a road and my brain seemingly without my own willing begins to beg a god i do not believe in to send a car crashing into me i stare out at train tracks and imagine how easy it would be to end myself in the blink of an eye i contemplate what it might feel like to overdose on every prescription medicine i own and i am terrified i know these thoughts are not normal they are not the usual thoughts which are common in ocd cases they are my brain beginning to try and ease itself into these ideas i do not want it to but i am not sure i have control over this i do not want to kill myself so much of me wants to live i have goals i have dreams and it hurts me to imagine leaving behind no legacy nothing at all it hurts to imagine never telling the stories i want to tell never growing up and e tongue sticking out eriencing all there is to e tongue sticking out erience this fear i have makes me want to believe there is no chance of me offing myself and yet i know something is very very wrong this time i hate so much of my life with a passion that i have not had in a long while my panic attacks are worse now and my habit of cutting as selfpunishment for being emotional has returned my depression this time seems utterly unbeatable doomed to worsen and worsen until i break and even though i try desperately to swear to myself i will not go through with anything stupid because i truly do not want to i can not swear on it i feel everything getting worse and worse and i no longer trust my own brain at all i feel like it is out to kill me I am terrified that at some point soon i will snap and kill myself without bothering to think anything through i hide my knife collection away from myself now because I am terrified that i might get too angry too focused on punishing myself for existing and i might go ahead and try to stab myself to death i do not know what to do I have been reading so many accounts here and so many of you are so concrete in either your willingness to live or your want to die i almost envy it and i feel awful to say that i think that i want to live but i do not trust myself enough to know i will not suddenly change my mind and I have been living these past few weeks in fear like i have never felt before i want to tell myself that fearing is good that it means i will not do anything but i know that is not true so many people fear they might snap before they do i do not want it to be me god i do not want it to be me please help me I am not sure how i just need to hear someone say something that lets me know i will not do something stupid i need someone to tell me I am not alone and that death is not my only option I am so worried that no matter what i do suicide will catch up to me and I will go through with it please fuck someone tell me it does not have to be the way i fear it is I am so alone and terrified and cannot even trust myself anymore can not even believe myself when i say i want to live without fearing i may be lying the more i sit alone with these thoughts the more inevitable suicide seems no matter how much i do not want it if anyone can give me a sign anything at all that i do not have to kill myself in the end i need it so desperately right now I have never been so afraid in my life i do not think i want to die","SuicideWatch"

"working on thingsI have dealt with depression and mental health issues for my entire life really was first taken for treatment when i was but had issues long before then I am now I have decided to try some different methods therapy did not work for me i always felt awkward and judged and i did not like it i did try multiple therapists because i know sometimes it can be a matter of finding one who is a good match with you maybe i never did that and that is why it did not work for me but i was limited by who accepted my insurance i went to a psychiatrist over the years I have been on and off meds i know not a good thing but i did stay on them consistently recently for about two years fluoxetine alprazalam abilify and found that while the depression was still there it was much more manageable things in my life changed and circumstances beyond my control made it to where i could no longer afford to see my psychiatrist and they refused to give any more refills without me coming in so i stopped my meds cold turkey i do not recommend this by the way my moms husband suffered from depression mood swings anxiety etc and she took him to a nutritionist who focused on functional medicine before seeing her he was also on multiple medications like i had been she did a lot of blood work and genetic testing found things his doctors never tested for or found and she gave him some medicine to try my mom said it has been night and day difference he went from literally being on the couch staying inside with no lights on ignoring his kids and family never going out to now feeling good losing weight he is happy etc and he is not taken a single prescription pill since november he started the functional medicine products in october so i have decided to give these supplements a try luckily for me part of my job is running a functional medicine website so i get a discount on the supplements even still i could not afford them so my mom bought them for me my mom is in the medical field and gave me a long e tongue sticking out lanation and breakdown of how these supplements work and how they compare to prescription pills and i think it is worth a try so once they arrive i will start taking them she said it will take about a month for me to start seeing any difference i will definitely give you all an update if there is something out there that can genuinely help i want to try it also i bought my son a puppy yesterday and I have found that us having him is encouraging us to be outdoors more we are housebreaking him so we go outside every hour and he has brought a lot of happiness to our home even in just one day tl wink r trying functional medicine instead of prescription meds to help with depression and anxiety and new puppy is helping lift my spirits","depression"
"I am not depressedalmost a year ago i took an attempt on my life i took too many medications and i was in the hospital for about two weeks after detoxing with hallucinations i told the doctors my family family friends and everyone that it was just a spur of the moment thing i told them that i did not really want to die but i lied i did and i had been thinking about it for years but it always felt theoretical i even called a suicide hotline once and tried to get help from my university but it did not help i think the problem is that I am not depressed i even went to hospital mandated therapy as an outpatient but nobody not the doctors or therapists believed that i was depressed and neither do i the biggest issue is that when i look at my future i do not see myself getting old i sometimes see nothing but darkness which is odd since i already graduated university at i am planning to get a job and my parents are proud of me but i do not care for the career that they chose for me people keep saying i am so nice and approachable and that is great for being a nurse my career but i just do not feel it when i try to picture my future as a nurse forever or for even a few years i see nothing i do not feel hopeless and I am happy most of the time but i just feel like nothing really matters we live in a large universe and even god or religion does not always help even when i tell myself that I will go to hell or something i accept the fact that I will finally know what comes after death if it is nothing then we should do whatever we want and nothing not love or money should matter on the other hand if it is some afterlife then why do we have one life so that we can transfer to another one and is that the last life and what is the purpose of living in this life if there is just another life waiting for us sorry I have gone completely off topic but i know that i still feel suicidal much of the time but I am not unhappy just confused i guess i wrote this to maybe see if it was just me who thought this way or if other people get it anyway thanks for reading or not reading","SuicideWatch"

"just wondering if this id the kind of place i could talk through some thingshi everyone bit of a story first I have struggled with depression for a very long time at least since i was a teenager and that was a good while ago now about this time last year however it hit me very hard suicide always seemed to enthusiastic or energetic for me to actually do anything but i did want to die i was apathetic in regards to living even though i actually have a pretty good life and a loving relationship i will not get into any more details about that because who needs that shit i was given antidepressants and the dosage was increased twice before i eventually started to come off them after about months i think i was also sent for psychotherapy cbt to be specific the cbt was on the nhs I am in the uk and was fucking shit like seriously bad like that guy the psychiatrist should quite his job and go flip burgers and he would contribute more to society i went to two sessions where i felt like i was just being processed i was asked questions and my answers were used to fill in a form i was given a book on cbt to go away and read and that is about all the therapy i got really the pills got me through it eventually i am very thankful for them and for my great gp who listened to me more than the shitty psychiatrist ever did the thing is even though i am nowhere near as bad as i was last year i still have a lot of problems in my thoughts and behaviour and i was looking into cbt to help me live a healthier life for example i procrastinate a lot a lot even when i have very important shit to do and i could easily do it I will still put it off and often just not do it i know some of you may say that i could start by getting off reddit but although i certainly use reddit it is not the problem if i quit reddit I will use something else to waste time I will use facebook twitter or netflix I will stare out the window whatever as long as it is not what i ought to be doing so i think this unhealthy behaviour may be related to my depression and I am trying to just fix it myself by looking into cbt everything I have tried has so far failed but I am giving it another shot i was wondering if those of you with e tongue sticking out erience in cbt could help me out i am listening to the cbt for dummies audiobook and it suggests analysing how I am feeling the thing is though my feelings do not really come into this when I am depressed i do not have feelings and when I am procrastinating it is not like the problem is anything to do with how I am feeling i think i may be just rambling now so apologies i guess my question is can i use cbt to stop procrastinating and be mentally healthier have you done it what did you do ideally I would be talking with a therapist instead of listening to an audiobook but i can not afford to see a therapist privately and there is no way I am going back to that shitty nhs guy holy shit I have rambled I am going to hit save anyway and see what happens","depression"

"i wrote this article yesterday about my own struggle with adhd anxiety depression it is helped a lot of my friends and family start a dialogue so i thought some of you might benefit from the readdo not worry it is a quick minute read i think it best reads on the site itself and includes some pictures if you would rather read it on reddit here ya go from the other side this is an article that ive wanted to write for some time i struggled with publishing it for two reasons first the effect i felt it would have on my relationships with my family friends and coworkers what would the impact be on my personal and professional life second the shame and extreme dissonance i felt in recounting my battle with my mental wellbeing will it come across as attention seeking is it too graphic why do i have to share it in the first place for all the reasons i shouldnt write and publish this article i am i want to start a dialogue i want to grab the attention of anyone reading it and tell them that mental health issues are real they are graphic they do have an effect on personal and professional relationships i know that most people who read this will not have previously known about my history but does that mean it didnt happen here are a few confessions that are going to be hard to read but i want you to anyway when i was i began my battle with depression when i was i came home to my mother crying the school called to let her know they found the cuts on my wrist from self harm by id lost half my friends because of my constant distrust of them at i had a panic attack in physics for a full five minutes shaking uncontrollably in front of the entire class until the nurse came and got me at i was told i couldnt make it to a good university with my level of effort when i was i was diagnosed with adhd and unintentionally abused my prescription medicine at shortly before i was scheduled to speak to the town about funding a youth center i was taken out of school for a short time after admitting suicidal intent reading that over it seems like a distant dream then i see a picture of myself like this one embarrassingly attempting to be emo and realize that this really did happen emo picture here i didnt always try to e tongue sticking out ress my depression so outwardly i wouldnt wear my efforts on my sleeve but apparently i did on my hoodie and thats tough because in these situations happiness takes work i went through therapy medicine lifestyle changes relationship management you name it but above anything else i just needed the affirmation that i was not alone this article isnt meant to tell you how to deal with your mental health so often when i was struggling people would unilaterally tell me how to get better dont get me wrong that is still important i wouldnt be where i am without professional help but just as important are the conversations we have with those in our own lives we all mask our battles when we are entrenched in them and i can understand why you dont tell the enemy your plans to defeat him he will only find a way to impede you when you do find the courage to talk about it people will always tell you one day things will be better but that day never feels close enough why is it then when we finally make it to the other side and reach that day we continue to silence ourselves maybe its because so few have said the same before so here i am talking with you from the other side conversations about mental health allow us to see its pervasiveness and the effect it has on those we love there are fathers sisters cousins coworkers and friends that we feel could never be afflicted and yet they are its those conversations and the dialogue created that enable those suffering to see that this is a shared issue to let them know that there is a way out to escape the harsh clutches of something that feels as if it will never let go about two years ago i was having a conversation with my friend we were walking side by side down our driveway back to our apartment in cape town i remember opening up telling her that i was struggling feeling as if it was my fault that i couldnt get over my depression and e tongue sticking out lore more of the city she stopped before we reached the gate looked at me and said a friend once told me that some of us just have lower resting states and thats ok i do too that was a turning point for me i mean a real turning point this girl is one of the nicest kindest and warm hearted individuals you could meet im not sure anyone would ever say anything different yet here she was just like me when you struggle with depression anxiety or adhd it feels as if its your fault that somehow your inability to absence yourself from or move beyond the incapacitation of your disease is a reflection of your worth when you hear from someone you love or respect talk about going through something similar you are revolutionized on the perspective of your own battle so here i am just like you shortly after taking a few days off my senior year of high school we got the youth center vote passed i then applied for my dream school the same week and despite the earlier remarks i made it in a few months later i learned from my past mistakes and how to live with my differences instead of in spite of them i graduated with two degrees cum laude and now have a job with a company that i have loved since i was im not saying this to applaud myself or make it sound easy im saying this to those that are in that lower state i am here just like you someone that struggled someone that fought

"too many battles to fight just too many problems to fix sometimes i just feel like it is not worth ithey so im new here just want to talk about my feelings and what not i have contemplated suicide but i would not really call myself suicidal maybe that means im in denial i dont know suicidal people do not want to die they just want the pain to end ^^ i feel like that quote sums it up there is a lot of stuff thats been going on in my life and sometimes i think its just not worth fixing like sure i could try work stuff out but i have so many problems and so many battles i have to fight that I have just kind of given up im not saying that other people have it easier than me im sure there are people that have it worse but this is not about what other people can or will endure its about what i can endure and what i want to endure ok so i feel like this post is making me sound really self centered now i have a lot of problems and im not even going to e tongue sticking out lain them all most of it can not be fixed by me or anyone else i have screwed up genetics and a lot of health issues that are going to affect me for the rest of my life is it so bad to die im not saying that death is going to be better than life or that there is something beyond death that you can look forward to but there comes a point when life just becomes too painful that you are willing to take the chance or maybe i can just drop out just drop out of society and its e tongue sticking out ectations go back live in nature try a different route or whatever worse thing that can happen is you commit suicide and like if thats what your contemplating already then why not give it a try i know i said i have a lot of problems and i was not going to e tongue sticking out lain them all but im gonna talk about this one problem so maybe i can understand it more for myself +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ society not really related to my problem but its related to society so i thought i might add it in here sunk cost fallacy is the name given to this thing i dont know how to e tongue sticking out lain it basically it e tongue sticking out lains when someone if gambling and they go all in not because they have a chance of winning but because they are trying to scare the other person or whatever its a horrible move to make and risks you losing everything but sunk cost fallacy is like when you put a lot of something effort money etc into something else you do not want to know that you have wasted it and that you have just thrown your stuff away so you put more money and more effort into it just so that you might get a return like you justify your spending by saying we have already put so much into it if we do not get anything back it will be a waste that was probably a horrible e tongue sticking out lanation so if you are interested you should probably just google it anyway the point is i think society is just stuck in one big sunk cost fallacy loop we have built up our society around technology so much that the only conceivable way to move forward or to advance or to improve is to build better computers and better technology and we feel this is the pinnacle of civilisation so we never loop back what if life was better back then back when everything was simpler sure you could say that if we did not have instruments then bach or another great musician would have never realised they loved music but is it really worth it are we really on the right path back to the original point of the problem i have with society its just people trying to validate themselves and what they do by judging everyone and making them all follow the same vision +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ok im sorry i just got hit by a wave of apathy and i do not want to finish this post anymore im still gonna put some more stuff tho +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ school ways to view school school is just a training ground to mold you into what society wants you to be and forces you to lose what you want to be and your self identity do you remember who you were before society told you who you should be school is a transport that brings you around and shows you all the things you could be although it only shows you the things that will be beneficial for society it never teaches you how to think for yourself how to force the government to change how to look after yourself etc and the thing is i think I have found what i want ive found my passion i am happy and i want to do it for the rest of my life but now school is getting in the way its like a bus that takes tourists around to all the ice cream shops to stop and let you have a taste but when you find the flavour you want to spend the rest of your life eating it goes nope you have to keep going also heres a random quote remember always follow your passion and if your passion does not fit into global capitalism well then you are a failure in life

battles for me to fight and that my life is to shitty i want to die but like i dont want to die and i know life can be wonderful but there are just too many battles for me to fight just too many

"starting over again but I am exhaustedI have been suicidal off and on but more on than off for most of my life the first time i remember wanting to kill myself i was maybe or i was an unwanted baby and was made well aware of how I would ruined my familys life i was constantly bullied in elementary school and hated being around people my own age the selfloathing and feeling of seperateness and not belonging started early until the past couple of years the driving force in my life was to prove i deserved to exist that there was a reason for me being born that everyone who did not love me or see my potential was wrong to reject me but now I am inescapably middleaged and I am tired so tired i have always been a highachieving student and i was the first one in my family to go to college and to really try to prove my worth i graduated law school too thing is i hated practicing law i wanted to work in a specific social movement but i applied and interned for a decade before getting a job in it i was always praised in other positions outside the movement and i did not understand how other people walked into the jobs i wanted right out of undergrad I am a hard worker smart friendly a teamplayerthe complaint i get from managers in the movement but not outside it is that i ask too many questions try to change improve things too much but still i finally landed this job and thought my real life was going to begin except i thought the organization was making serious strategic mistakes when I would been there for a while and thought i could start voicing my opinion i was routinely ignored or shot down sometimes with someone else coming up with the idea a few months later sometimes with my manager seeming to almost purposely misunderstand my intent after i e tongue sticking out ressed some very real concerns about the organizations strategy and tactics i was fired that was at the beginning of the pandemic and I have been trapped in debt quicksand ever since I have also had two very serious relationships absolutely crash and burn in front of me in the past few years although i did everything i could think of to save them i think i tolerated much more than the average person would tried many more resources and suggestions to help than most people would i gave a lot too much I would probably say to each one with only a broken heart to show for it I am now in my late s and have absolutely nothing to show for it my career has floundered my relationships have ended painfully i do not get along with most of my family and i never stay in one place long enough because I am chasing jobs andor relationships to make lasting friendships i do not own any property I am broke and I have failed at everything i ever wanted or tried to do it may be selfpitying but i feel like a lot of people get a lot more in life with a lot less effort I have held off for years on ending it because i know it would kill my mother who sacrificed everything to raise me my plan is that when she passes I will take myself out too shortly thereafter i was never supposed to be in this world so I will just finally be righting a wrong it is very comforting to know that when the time is right I will be able to end things on my own terms the thing is it is getting harder to wait i used to have drive passion i used to relish an adventure and starting over now I am forced to do that again but I am just so tired the drive and the passion are gone and i just want to be left alone until i wither away I am on antidepressants and have been for years this is the best combination I have found so far i see a therapist who i really like but living is just too much to bear anymore i know it is horrible but i just wish this virus would take me out so i would not have to feel the pain and worry and stress anymore but it would not be seen as my fault i do not know what i e tongue sticking out ect anyone to say to this i do not know what anyone could say to a failure so complete it is almost ludicrous just wanted to get it out i suppose thanks for reading","SuicideWatch"

"the first time I have ever felt like killing myself is shockingjanuary of this year i was accused of cheating on my ex boyfriend of a year with a good friend of mine this in itself stings because i love a person hard often to the dismissal of their major flaws that they are abusive or cheat or are simply disrespectful and treat me as a possession what followed his accusation was terrifying he threatened me with violence brandished a knife threatened to kill me and kicked me out of his apartment with nothing but my clothes my computer and my textbooks i had to spend a great amount of my carefully budgeted savings moving back across the country to the only place that i knew i had friends I have been blaming myself for all of it even though the previous relationship was terrible my ex broke up with me or times and then emotionally manipulated me to do things for him after because he would tell me that i was the fucked up one i was looking for a way out for a while i think and emotionally withdrawn but i had no reasonable reason to leave a stable home until he threatened my life foolishly i got emotionally involved with the person who spurred the accusation of cheating i can not say whether or not i was seriously emotionally involved before or after the end of my previous relationship but it happened even though nothing inappropriate occured during or right after my previous relationship i have constantly been questioning whether or not it was my fault that i was threatened and abused for keeping company my ex did not like now this person has confessed he does not share my feelings and may never be able to reciprocate the way i deserve he says he cares about me and for me but does not want a relationship i do not disagree because he is very private and it is difficult for me to be with someone who is not completely open this is devastating to me because i was so incredibly happy and optimistic he was kind and attentive intelligent funny and responsible he was thoughtful about my problems and listened now i feel as though that I have done something horrible and i deserve to have that taken away from me even though i know that it is wrong to think like that when you absolutely cannot control how another person feels for you no matter how much you want them to love you i have finals right now fall will be the last semester i have before getting my ba i should be happy with that but i have no family to help me pay for anything i havent spoken to my father since i was now and my mother is a severe alcoholic i am going to be swimming in loan repayment as soon as i graduate i do not find a job i get interviews I am enthusiastic and skilled I am upbeat and friendly and i genuinely want to be there and work for them and put my education to the test I have applied everywhere from just above my qualifications to the very bottom of the barrel I have called back and been present and interested and asked questions I have dressed nicely and never hesitated to answer a question thoughtfully and honestly it does not seem to matter to them though they either think i will not stay with the company or that i am not e tongue sticking out erienced enough the latter idea is understandable but how am i supposed to finish my degree when i can not pay my electric bill to take my online courses i woke up this morning and filled out three job applications i did homework i cleaned my room and took a shower and pampered myself a bit and then i just sat on my bed and cried and cried because i am so overwhelmingly lonely and feel as though no one will ever love me not because I am unlovable but just because every good thing in my life feels like it just eventually gets taken away from me like some unwritten cosmic rule that if one small thing makes me happy the rest of my life has to be some out of control shitstorm the last time i had a healthy long term relationship i ended up homeless and starving when i was no longer homeless and starving the relationship ended i had a physical several weeks ago and i wanted to cry because the physician was the first person who had touched me in three years that did not want something sexual from me i was nervous about being nude in front of her and she months pregnant and with this infinitely maternal e tongue sticking out ression put her hand on my bare back and made a soothing noise i have so many people who tell me they care about me I am not quiet about how i feel not a single one of them has staved off the loneliness not a single person in my life right now is willing to really be empathetic instead of uncomfortable about my honest I am normally the strong one I am normally the one that listens to problems and it feels like no one has thought that maybe i could seriously use some comfort as well so this morning i thought about killing myself in this hopelessly desperate and detached way i did not fantasize about how i just tried to lay there and will myself into nonexistence I have never been so tired of hurting and I am tired of people telling me how strong i am when i have never had a chance in my life to be anything except strong i do not think i am suicidal but this is a new extreme of emotion for me and i have absolutely no idea how to handle myself and my loneliness","SuicideWatch"

"a little story about following your whimshey all I am not subscribed here and i really only visit when I am in a low spot but i feel like i should post my adventure today who knows maybe it will inspire someone a little background info I have been diagnosedon drugs for depression and anxiety for the past year and i had a period of about six months in which i went to therapy overall it works pretty well and i can function but as all longterm sufferers know there will always be days that suck today was one of those days i felt like crap for other reasons and something just set me off into a dark spot i was basically on my bed crying for a bit not being entertained by anything online and not having any friends online to talk to i was miserable but then i had a whim go on a walk now i know that it is way easier to think of doing something than to actually get up and do it especially in the first few months all those suggestions to go out and exercise seemed like bs to me but i guess now that I have learned how to deal with it better I have learned to listen to myself more i was so miserable that i just wanted to distract myself however i could so i got up put on a sweater and took the five minute walk to a place nearby to watch a fountain and think and that is what i did i basically sat there fairly hungry because i hadnt gotten around to making dinner yet and thought for like half an hour i just let my mind wander and tried to focus on things other than my negativefeedback loop and then suddenly i thought i should make pancakes so i went home and made some motherflipping pancakes get it cuz you flip pancakes i really do not know where I am going with this it is pretty long and pointless really but i guess what I am saying is there will always be hard times but if there is any small part of your brain that is saying to do something try your best to listen i know that not everyone here has someone that they know cares about them and i know that sometimes life seems pointless and hard and you just wanna make it go away but there are little things you can do to enjoy it i know it is hard especially when your own mind and body are fighting against you but life is not usually as negative as your depression makes it out to be if you feel hopeless there are always people to talk to or nature to go out and just think in seriously just going outside and sitting down somewhere can work wonders because it gets you out of your negative spot both physically and mentally do not give up life may see bad but there are still good things in the world I will stop with the rambling cliches now but seriously stay strong rdepression tl wink r when you are feeling depressed make pancakes","depression"
"at what point do you give up on medsin the past two years I have been on all sorts of different antidepressants with very little success i no longer feel like killing myself every day but still seems to creep into my head once or twice a week like andrew solomon said mostly do not just to keep from hurting people around me but most of the other stuff that comes with depression is still fairly persistent i recently did a dna test to show my psychologist what might stand a better chance at working when we went over the results the first thing she said was it is not what we were hoping to see and said it is treatment resistant i was also told a shortly into seeing her that i am unipolar back to the point i am so sick of trying all these different drugs and the side effects that come with them i can only imagine that at some point you have got to just give up on the drugs I am sure others have been in the same boat and am not really sure what to do about it except deal with it sorry this is a rambling mess and am not really e tongue sticking out ecting a reply the anxiety that i have even typing this on a throwaway account is staggering and am going to have to hit submit quickly before i convince myself it will just annoy everyone","depression"

just failed a course what the fuck am i doing i just really want to get out of this holethe bottom half of this post is just detailsventing so you do not necessarily have to read it to get the gist of it sorry i wrote a shitton here i realize that i wrote all of this just about my own problems i feel as though I am selfish because so many of you are probably going through way worse shit than my st world problems but goddammit i feel sad right now and i never wrote about it today i learned now so i guess I am posting this to help me at least to some degree through writing the possibility of some support from this subreddit undergraduate collegeuni student here trying to get my bachelors as an architecture major this month of may my story kiss i was an idiot i never scheduled my classes well so i took credit hours this semester to graduate on time which is the maximum amount of credits i could take wo paying extra tuition fees before everything got shitty kiss the st months into my semester went ok w just few academic mishaps few missing assignmentslate attendanceabsence but i still kept my body healthy and my hobbies piano in tune how everything is shitty now kiss and then starting couple of weeks ago right around spring break I have been crashing burning i stopped turning things in on time i became regularly late to my st classes of the day then it got to a point where i just decide to not leave my apartment for some days it is been a month now since I have worked out or played basketball and piano has been the only thing that i looked forward to but now i just recently have stopped going into the piano practice room too only thing I am doing more is drinking some of the shit that happened to me to make me feel so shitty kiss family issues learned over my spring break that my dads leaving my mom this summer worrying how my nonenglishspeaking korean mother of mine will have to live by herself for indefinite years not exactly divorce apparently but details on another section if you are interested enough to read about it credithour semester sucks ass i have no time to relax but when i do decide to relax something inevitably does not get done on time the postcollege life scares the shit out of me couple of architecture firms are interested in me to work for them but i still do not know if I will get a wellpaying job after graduation this one awesome girl does not like me back do not want to get into details here it is just my own selfish relationship bullshit I am hurting because i desired someone I have dealt with this before got a f in a class just read an excuse memail from my prof learned that i failed a fucking class today because i never turned anything on time which is my own damn fault i really fucked myself over because i can barely afford to pay another tuition fee for another semester because of ^ failing that class i will not be able to get my degree for another few months i guess if you put it in that perspective it is not the worst thing in the world but fuck i really do not have anymore money for another semester my current rx + my history with depression kiss I have been medicated for depression for a few years now I am currently on bupropion hc xl mg taking tablet whenever i wake up i think I am going to ask my psychiatrist about this in days from now so she may prescribe me heavier dosage or prescribe me with different meds i have resorted to selfharm in the past but with counseling and sessions with my psychiatrists I have managed fairly well to avoid doing that for a couple of years now some details about my situation ranting venting do not really have to read this kiss i do not think meds will solve everything and i think the biggest thing is to break my awful habits mostly consisting of being online for at least hoursday lateness to change my course of thought and stop berating myself so much because i feel so damn incompetent on a lot of days now i really do not like myself right now i can tell from not being confident next to people anymore i do not know what my mom will have to go through when my dad leaves her sometime this summer and i just got an excuse memail today that i will not be able to pass one of the courses to get my degree this may it is my own damn fault the course is called wpp writing proficiency course did not turn anything on time i had a crush on my friend and i recently learned this week that the feelings were not mutual i guess this event did hurt a lot at the time but I have managed to cope with it although it is just that just seeing her name flattens my mood instantly my dad wants to try his hand at real estate career i respect my stereotypical golflovinghighe tongue sticking out ectationasian dad I would be such a better person if i had his mental fortitude discipline and toughness and i know this would be good for him because owning working at a dry cleaning business for hours a day for days a week has been depressing hotmuggy dull and depressing enough for so many years now my relationship with my reticent father is now estranged i know he loves me i think it is been years since I have uttered those sentimental words to him i dont know it will be awkward as fuck if i say it i think we are implying that we share a common love shared among a family but the thing is that dammit i feel as though i disappoint him so much it got to a point where i do not talk to him anymore because i just feel bad that i have not accomplished anything major in my life yet apparently the fact that my dad is leaving my mom this summer is not a divorce but it does not sound like an example of a healthy relationship within a family one thing that i really hate is that i can not communicate with my mom dad effectively with any details and eloquence anymore because my native language korean has degraded into a cavetalk version of korean ever since i decided to assimilate myself into the american life and completely learn a new language english obviously more than a decade ago oh other thing i am so ashamed to say this but it is taken me years so far just to finish my undergrad I have failed some classes tried to switch majors in the past it became a mess in the end as now i am crawling my way out of an undergraduate program within years i eventually want to be a licensed architect in us which means finish this goddamn bachelors program that I am fucking up so much get another degree by getting a masters degree in architecture but i do not even know if i can get into a graduate school with my awful academic history grades for my undergrad years log in hours of internship that will probably take years of internship pass the architecture registration exam equivalent to bar exam for lawyers basically i still have a long way to go before i can finally achieve one of my primary goals in life tl wink r recently doing really shitty in college I am showing some obvious signs of depression meds will not solve everything so i just need help to change my perspective on things before i selfdestruct any further thank you just wanted to vent reflect on my life through some writing so i honestly will not mind too much if i do

"a fake buddhist perspective on suicidesuicidal depression the desire to kill yourself so much that the downsides of suffering do not outweigh the upsides of living anymore the desire to kill your self it is weird that i said your self like they were two things right there is the owner you and the owned self you own this machine that runs you and sometimes this machine just fails to run you the way you want to run so you can do two things check that your e tongue sticking out ectations are reasonable or fix up your machine modern psychotherapy is very focused on the make sure that your e tongue sticking out ectations are reasonable side of things there is a lot of cbtstyle therapies that want you to say no my self is running fine I am just being extracritical of it and i should tweak the selfcriticism dial of the machine down a bit but you can only tune your e tongue sticking out ectations so low before you start asking how such a meaningless life is worth living right so it is our jobs to tune up the machines part of this is taking a dispassionate look at the self pay attention to your thoughts and dissect them spend an hour a day thinking about how you think writing down moments that bugged you e tongue sticking out laining how a germ of a thought turned into an obsession turned into a rumination turned into a depression because the answer is there and you know it if it is something you would like to forget you have to make a deal with your self to learn whatever lesson you can learn from it before it will forget key thing to remember you own you you have no responsibility to other people to keep your personality stable it is their job to live with you tl wink r instead of killing yourself find out what your self really needs","depression"

at least seen by other to sometimes i cant help but feel the only reason why i was placed on this earth was to show others this is what happens if you do not follow the norm i often ask my self why am i here my family ok it comes first but after that wash dishes that seems to be all I am good at i only ever got cs in school thanks to the disable learning put before my name if it wast for that i would have failed school people ask me simple everyday questions all i can think is what simple thought thought processes are lost on me i sit here alone in my room nearing and all i have to show from my self is scares all over my hands and a past consisting of false positives being told to me in hopes of jump starting a passion in my life my biggest regret in not giving my parent and grandparents children in which they desire i fear i will not give them their life time its nothing they have done they did there best in trying to get me to be social in my lifetime not in a forcefully way but in a natural way but natural does not come to me it never has i think in a way that seems obtuse to everyone else again i hear that is good no no its not females look at me and only see one thing a time

"i should try medication but I am scaredtldr my depression is back and i think i need medication but i do not know how to tell also I am afraid because I have heard a lot of bad things about depression meds hi all let me start by saying I am really disappointed in myself for having to post here I have posted here before it is been a while almost exactly a year i saw a therapist and managed to get myself out of my depression and turn my life around it was solely cognitive behavioral therapy no medication and it worked wonders but i stopped seeing her about months ago and now I am back in the same rut i was in a year ago I am a firm believer that the only way to really cure depression is through talk therapy you have to rewire your brain to think differently and i actually managed to do it over the summer i was like a different person but now i find myself with some of the same terrible thoughts i had before not on the same scale it used to be would anyone really care if i died and now i just feel generally helpless i confess that sometimes i think about hurting myself if i just turn the steering wheel a little bit to the left if i just do not look before i cross the road it is a cry for attention that is all it is i recognize that i only think about hurting myself as a wake up call to other people and i feel absolutely horrible about that my point is obviously cbt was not the panacea i thought it was it only helped me temporarily I am going to see another therapist once the new semester starts in january I am a freshman in college so i can not really see one over the holidays and i wonder if taking medication would help me but i do not know how to tell if i need them i also have severe generalized anxiety disorder actually more severe than my depression i kind of want to try meds for that too i also am afraid of how they will make me feel i know people who have gotten worse on meds who have suicidal ideations because of it physiological side effects I am really worried but if it will help me longterm then maybe i need to try can someone tell me about medication personal anecdotes statistics i do not care i just need help","depression"

"i needed to write about how i feel any advicewhat i feel its hard for me to ever e tongue sticking out lain anything i need or want to i feel in my life i have no one to talk toon the outside i seem like someone who is happy but that is far from truei dont have anyone to talk to which is hard i cant talk to my parents about anything especially my depression or anxiety because they just think it is an excuse and that i am lazy no one ever takes the time to ask me how im doing maybe because i seem happy all my life i was teased it started out because i was a small kid and was smart i was able to read a news paper article and speck to my dad about it at the age of i was smarter than most kids not all but most and eventually i was no longer the small kid i was a fat kid i never really ate unhealthy but my mom was a single mother who fed me what she could i got teased for being fat up from th to th grade on top of the size i was also teased because i stutter and mumble my words a lot which to this day still affects me maybe even worst im not sure if its because im a hyper person or because just i think faster than i can speak im not sure but i hate it something i always wanted to do i never played pop warner because i never told anyone i wanted to when i was younger my church even was a sponsor for the team i wanted to play for one time i brought it up and my mother said she couldnt do it because of money and also probably cause of transportation im not sure why i couldnt do it but my sister could attend sewing classes that cost x as much as pop warner i felt like none was interested in me from a very young age in th grade my dad finally came back after being in jail for years he pushed me to try pop warner but i was too heavy to play midgets so i went home and cried for im not sure how long maybe even days but i coped with it i would just go home and play xbox with my friends who i didnt even know in real life i had friends in school who i didnt really have anything in common with or hung out with outside of school because my mom worked late and i had no transportation but i passed middle school not doing anything cause it was easy and all i had to do was pass my hsa testing to be promoted to high school or something I am not sure how but i did thoughi my freshman year i finally got to play football the one thing i would dream about ever since i was not allowed to play as a kid my first day in pads i got the wind knocked out of me by a + senior center who had offers to play at uh manoa yeah that big but i got back up and kept marching on because it was something i loved keala the guy who laid me out was even my mentor he taught me how to snap a football and how to block he played his whole senior year with a broken hand i looked up to him he was like a older brother i never had along with the jv team who was bonded together like brothers by our coach sipou seepoh he was hard and said something to us and me once in a while but he really was there not to win but for us his team and his sons i played most of my year as a back up but i didnt have a problem i still played a lot and i was just glad to be able to contribute i went to practice everyday on time and made sure i was doing good with grades one game our jv center got hurt so i got pushed into center roll although i knew how to snap i hadnt done it it a game i was usually a tackle or a guard and on top of that we had min to score point or we would lose and on the last play of the game our last chance to score i snapped the ball to high and we couldnt convert i felt that i had let my team down i put my head down so no one could see my tears but once our game was done my coach came to me and pulled me aside and said he was never so proud of any player hes coached because i stepped up when i was needed to do what i needed to do although i messed up the last snap i was the only one who stepped up when they were calling for a replacement when our center went down and right there my tears stopped we finished the season with only one loss and we blew out ever team we played i played rugby after football and it was another sport i fell in love with i hated my team though there was a lot of drama and inter conflict but we won states and it was all good my sophomore year i was playing football again but i changed completely i was no longer a lb short thick guy i turned in to a more slender lb linebacker and defensive end i learned quickly which was something i was good at and i was able to execute what i needed to do but i was never given an opportunity and going into the first game of the season i got asked to play offensive line as well since i knew how to ad the newer kids sucked so i started as a center and i never really played defense much because i was already working hard on offense anyway we kinda have a mediocre season but i didnt care because i knew i did my best and i made an effort on and off the field again my sophomore year i played rugby and i was so stoked because we were gonna play a team from australia i was going to practice everyday and i actually had fallen in love with rugby more than football i felt so happy when i would get the ball and run people over but at practice a day before we played the australia during a scrimmage i got the ball and went to side step someone but my foot hit a mud hole and i slipped feet in the air and all of my larger growing body about lbs fell directly on my shoulder i actually felt like my back just cracked and i was sore of course but just rested the rest of the day hoping it would feel better about hrs later it still hurt and every movement would hurt but i still played in the game i just taped my shoulder but after a while i realized the pain was to much and i asked my coach to pull me out later on that week i got an mri and it revealed i tore my labrum and rotator cuff the orthopedic was amazed i was able to play through the pain but he didnt clear me to play anymore because of the damage it would cause and he said i needed surgery to repair it and there would be no other way i never got surgery i was able to play and my shoulder held up mostly it would get sore and my coaches understood but when my junior year came around i started playing football again this is where my troubles began i went to practice everyday on time and i put in my work i was in the first team defense as an end but when the most favorited player comes back from his vacation he gets on the field and the coach pulls me out and i didnt see much playing time after that this kid had bad grades and was lazy and never went to practice but he has so much talent he still started over me because of favoritism i believe i was a good player i wasnt better than him but i could do what was needed just as good as he could but unfortunately my shoulder plagued me i felt that everything was going wrong at this point i was dreaming of playing college ball even at a just checking but i felt that wasnt gonna happen because i felt that i wasnt good enough i feel this is where i took a downwards spiral i didnt want to do anything in school because i had no motivation i felt worthlessmy grade started dropping because i didnt even ant to wake up in the morning i started smoking weed because it makes me feel better and it relieves pain around october that year i came home one day and i heard news that my grand ma had passed away i felt even more worse although i didnt speak to her much except over the phone she was the only person whoever wanted to talk to me felt she was the only person who would initiate conversations with me i felt like i was always the one having to do so with other so felt torn and i fell deeper into a hole and i ended up getting in trouble for weed and got suspended which dug me even further i finished the year only passing classes auto and history but i met the girl who i want to marry and settle down with it sounds stupid coming from a year old but i mean it shes everything i want and need another thing is her family makes me feel like im one of them they treated me differently than anyone else had before and i was only a stranger who was dating their daughterniecegranddaughter i love my parents and my family but i dont have anything in common and i feel that all they do is judge me but also they dont know me they dont try to talk to me they kind of ignore me so i had some little light of hope to hold onto i was sub consciously suicidal even i didnt realize to later my senior year i started out good and i decided to play football even though i had my injury but my shoulder had its problems but i over came them but the bigger problem was i didnt get any playing time even at practices i wouldnt get reps or anything i felt like shit so again my grades dropped and now im trying to catch up so i can graduate but recently things have been taking another deeper downwards spiral my depression has gotten worse because i have finally became aware of it i wish sometimes i could die because i feel worthless i feel i have been cheated out of the things i love i feel that ive been given the shit end of the stick i have bad eyesight i have fucked up shoulder and i can barely speak without stuttering i have developed anger issues im not sure why but i have and i fell even more worse because my girlfriend has gotten the worst of it i seem to blow up on her a lot and she doest deserve it because all shes ever done is be there for me but now her mom is sending her to oahu for college because me and her argue to much which has also been bringing me down ive become destructive and even more depressed i ask god why he has done this to me and i still have no answers i feel lost and alone even though there are so many people out there for me but no one makes a connection with me not even my family they blame it on me being lazy and a stoner and other things they dont understand how i feel and no one does because i put on this face of happiness and i act like nothing bothers me i have never told anyone about my anxiety of taking to people or teachers about serious things because of being teased for speaking weird but now a days i feel like beating the life out of anyone who pisses me off but i push it away because that is not the right thing and i would never do that but i wish i could all the time i wish i could end my life but for some reason i always have just enough to push on even though im miserable i want to join the marines but i have this fear that my shoulder will prevent me from doing so im making up my classes to graduate and its there in my grasp but i feel like im still being pulled down and im constantly fighting the urge to give up and still no ones there for me my mom asked me if i want to talk to a professional but im not sure how thats going to help i just dont know what to do anymore and i still wonder where is the god who i have been told all my life is going to save me and help me and also i feel like im gonna loose the only person who has ever cared for me","depression"
